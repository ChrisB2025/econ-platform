# The Neoclassical View: Inflation as a Demand and Expectations Problem

## The Core Idea

The mainstream or neoclassical view—the perspective taught in most economics textbooks and guiding most central banks—treats inflation as fundamentally about balance. When total spending in the economy (aggregate demand) exceeds what the economy can actually produce (aggregate supply), prices rise. The job of policymakers, especially central banks, is to keep demand and supply in balance to maintain stable prices.

In the long run, this view holds that inflation is closely tied to money: if the money supply grows faster than the economy's output, prices will eventually rise. But in the short run, many factors can push prices around—oil shocks, wage pressures, changes in expectations, shifts in demand. Central banks must navigate these disturbances while keeping inflation low and stable.

## How Inflation Happens

The neoclassical framework identifies several pathways to inflation:

**Demand-pull inflation** occurs when there's too much spending relative to the economy's capacity. Perhaps the government runs large deficits, or consumers go on a spending spree, or exports boom. Businesses can't keep up with demand, so they raise prices.

**Cost-push inflation** occurs when the costs of production rise—perhaps oil prices spike, or wages increase faster than productivity, or supply chains break down. Firms pass these higher costs on to consumers as higher prices.

**Expectations-driven inflation** occurs when people start expecting prices to rise. Workers demand higher wages to keep up with expected inflation. Firms raise prices in anticipation of higher costs. These expectations can become self-fulfilling, creating an inflationary spiral that's hard to break.

The key insight of modern mainstream economics is that expectations matter enormously. If people believe the central bank will keep inflation low, they act accordingly—and that makes low inflation easier to achieve. If people lose faith in the central bank's commitment, expectations can become "unanchored," and inflation becomes much harder to control.

## The Phillips Curve and the NAIRU

A central concept in mainstream thinking is the Phillips curve—the idea that there's a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. When unemployment is low and labor markets are tight, workers can demand higher wages, which feeds into higher prices. When unemployment is high, wage pressure is weak, and inflation tends to fall.

But this trade-off, mainstream economists argue, only exists in the short run. In the long run, the economy gravitates toward a "natural rate" of unemployment—sometimes called the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment). If the government tries to push unemployment permanently below this natural rate, the result won't be sustained low unemployment—it will be accelerating inflation.

This is why mainstream economists are wary of policies that try to eliminate unemployment through spending: there's a limit to how low unemployment can go before inflation takes off.

## Policy Prescriptions

The mainstream prescription is clear: give an independent central bank the job of maintaining price stability, and trust it to adjust interest rates as needed.

**Inflation targeting**: Most central banks now operate with an explicit inflation target, typically around 2%. The target anchors expectations and provides a benchmark for policy.

**Interest rate adjustments**: When inflation rises above target, the central bank raises interest rates. Higher rates make borrowing more expensive and saving more attractive, which cools spending and reduces inflationary pressure. When inflation is too low or recession threatens, the central bank cuts rates to stimulate spending.

**Central bank independence**: To maintain credibility, the central bank should be insulated from political pressure. Politicians might be tempted to boost the economy before elections, but this short-term thinking leads to inflation. An independent central bank can take the long view.

**Clear communication**: Modern central banks put great emphasis on transparency. By clearly communicating their intentions and their reaction to economic data, they help anchor expectations and make policy more effective.

## Strengths of This View

- **Institutional success**: The period from 1985 to 2007, sometimes called the "Great Moderation," saw low and stable inflation in most developed economies. Many attribute this to improved central bank frameworks.

- **Theoretical coherence**: The model provides a unified framework linking money, output, employment, and prices.

- **Policy guidance**: The framework gives central bankers clear guidance: watch inflation expectations, adjust rates in response to deviations from target, communicate clearly.

- **Volcker disinflation**: When the Federal Reserve raised rates sharply in the early 1980s, inflation fell from double digits to around 4%—demonstrating that determined monetary policy can break inflation, even if the cost (a severe recession) is high.

## Limitations and Critiques

Mainstream economists acknowledge several challenges:

- **The Phillips curve has flattened**: The relationship between unemployment and inflation has become much weaker in recent decades. Low unemployment no longer reliably predicts higher inflation.

- **The "missing inflation" puzzle**: After the 2008 financial crisis, central banks engaged in massive monetary expansion (quantitative easing), yet inflation remained stubbornly below target for years. The quantity theory predicted inflation that didn't arrive.

- **The NAIRU is hard to estimate**: The "natural rate" of unemployment cannot be directly observed. Estimates have shifted dramatically over time, raising questions about whether it's a useful policy guide.

- **Interest rates hit zero**: When rates fall to zero, conventional monetary policy loses its power. Central banks had to invent new tools (QE, forward guidance) whose effectiveness is debated.

- **Distributional blindness**: The mainstream framework focuses on aggregates—total output, average prices—and has less to say about who wins and who loses from inflation or from anti-inflation policy.

## Key Figures

- **Milton Friedman**: Introduced the "natural rate" hypothesis, arguing there's no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment
- **Edmund Phelps**: Independently developed the expectations-augmented Phillips curve (Nobel Prize 2006)
- **John Taylor**: Developed the "Taylor Rule" for setting interest rates
- **Ben Bernanke**: Former Fed Chair, architect of inflation targeting at the Federal Reserve

## In Practice

Most of the world's central banks operate broadly within this framework. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and many others target low inflation (usually 2%) and adjust interest rates to achieve it. When inflation surged in 2021-2022, these central banks responded with aggressive rate increases—the textbook response, though one that carries costs in terms of slower growth and higher unemployment.

Whether this framework adequately explains the 2021-2023 inflation episode—which seemed to originate in supply disruptions rather than excess demand—remains actively debated.
