[INTRO MUSIC - 5 seconds]

**MODERATOR:**

Welcome to our debate on one of the most contested questions in economics: What causes inflation?

I'm joined today by three economists representing different schools of thought. Each will present their view and respond to challenges from the others.

Let me introduce our participants. First, representing the mainstream or New Keynesian view. Second, representing post-Keynesian economics. And third, representing Modern Monetary Theory, or MMT.

Let's begin with opening statements. Mainstream, you're up first.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**MAINSTREAM:**

Thank you. The mainstream view is straightforward: inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply.

When there's more spending in the economy than the economy can absorb at current prices, something has to give—and that something is the price level.

In the short run, many factors can push demand around—fiscal policy, monetary policy, changes in confidence. But in the long run, inflation is fundamentally about the balance between money and output.

The key to controlling inflation is managing expectations and using monetary policy wisely. Independent central banks with clear inflation targets have delivered decades of low, stable inflation in most developed economies. The Great Moderation from 1985 to 2007 is our evidence that this approach works.

When inflation does spike, central banks should respond by raising interest rates. This cools demand, anchors expectations, and brings inflation back to target. Yes, there may be short-term costs in terms of slower growth—but the alternative, unanchored inflation, is worse.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**MODERATOR:**

Thank you. Post-Keynesian, your opening statement.

**POST-KEYNESIAN:**

The mainstream story sounds tidy, but it misses what's actually happening in most inflation episodes.

Inflation isn't primarily about demand—it's about costs and conflict.

When oil prices spike, that's not demand-pull. When wages rise because workers can't afford rent, that's not demand-pull. When firms with market power raise prices to boost profit margins, that's not demand-pull.

Most real-world inflation starts with cost shocks—energy, commodities, supply disruptions—or with distributional conflict. Workers want higher wages. Firms want higher profits. The government needs taxes. If these claims add up to more than one hundred percent of the pie, prices rise.

And here's what the mainstream gets wrong about policy: raising interest rates doesn't fix cost-push inflation. It causes unemployment. That's not a side effect—that's the mechanism. You beat down inflation by beating down workers.

Instead, we should address costs directly: invest in energy, build housing, use income policies to coordinate wage and price growth. That's harder than just raising rates, but it doesn't require sacrificing jobs.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**MODERATOR:**

Thank you. MMT, your opening statement.

**MMT:**

I agree with much of what my post-Keynesian colleague said, but I want to add something crucial: we need to understand what money actually is.

For a government that issues its own currency—like the US, UK, Japan, Australia—the constraint isn't money. The government can always create more dollars or pounds. It cannot run out.

The real constraint is productive capacity. Inflation occurs when spending—whether public or private—exceeds what the economy can actually produce. When you try to hire workers who are already employed, or buy materials that don't exist, prices rise.

So here's the reframe: instead of asking "can we afford this program," we should ask "do we have the real resources?" If there are unemployed workers and idle factories, government spending puts them to work—no inflation. Only when you hit real capacity constraints does spending become inflationary.

And the Job Guarantee is key. If government offers employment at a fixed wage to everyone who wants it, you get full employment AND price stability. The fixed wage acts as an anchor.

Interest rate policy? Basically useless at best, harmful at worst. It works by causing unemployment—which is cruel—and higher rates are actually income for bondholders, which could be inflationary.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**MODERATOR:**

Thank you all. Now let's have some direct engagement. Mainstream, how do you respond to the claim that most inflation is cost-push, not demand-pull?

**MAINSTREAM:**

Cost shocks certainly exist—oil prices, supply disruptions. But here's the thing: a cost shock is a one-time shift in prices, not ongoing inflation.

For a cost shock to become sustained inflation, it has to be accommodated. If oil prices rise and the central bank keeps policy loose, the price increase spreads through the economy and becomes embedded in expectations. Then you get ongoing inflation.

The key question is: does the central bank maintain credibility? If people believe the bank will keep inflation at 2%, they don't build higher inflation into wage negotiations and pricing decisions. The cost shock is temporary.

If the bank loses credibility—if people think inflation will persist—then expectations become unanchored, and temporary shocks become permanent inflation.

That's why central bank credibility matters so much. And that's why we need independent central banks committed to price stability.

**POST-KEYNESIAN:**

That story sounds good in theory, but look at what happened in 2021-2022. Inflation surged worldwide—supply chains, shipping costs, then energy prices from the Ukraine war.

This was textbook cost-push. It had nothing to do with demand exceeding supply in most sectors. Yet central banks raised rates aggressively anyway.

And you know what? Inflation came down—but was that because of the rate hikes, or because supply chains normalized and energy prices fell? The rate hikes happened *at the same time* as supply recovered. You can't just assume causation.

Meanwhile, those rate hikes caused real harm: higher mortgage payments, business failures, layoffs. If the inflation was supply-driven, all that pain was unnecessary.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**MAINSTREAM:**

But expectations matter. Even if the initial shock was supply-side, letting inflation run risks embedding it in expectations. The Fed was right to act decisively to prevent that.

And frankly, we don't know what would have happened without the rate increases. Maybe inflation would have persisted. The counterfactual is unknowable.

**MMT:**

Can I jump in here? The mainstream is assuming interest rates control inflation through demand reduction. But there's another channel nobody mentions: interest payments.

When the Fed raises rates, it pays more interest to bondholders. That's income going to wealthy investors. It's actually putting more money into the economy, not less.

Now, the standard transmission story says higher rates reduce borrowing and spending. But empirically, this channel is weaker than assumed—especially when households aren't that rate-sensitive.

And here's the real problem: even if rate hikes reduce inflation, they do it by causing unemployment. We're deliberately making people lose their jobs to bring down prices. Is that really the best tool we have?

**MAINSTREAM:**

What's the alternative? Fiscal policy is slow—you can't pass legislation in response to every inflation uptick. Income policies have a terrible track record. The central bank can act quickly and independently.

I agree rate hikes have costs. But inflation also has costs—especially for workers whose wages don't keep up. You have to weigh the trade-offs.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**MODERATOR:**

Let's talk about the NAIRU—the idea that there's a natural unemployment rate below which inflation accelerates. MMT and post-Keynesian economics are skeptical. Can you explain why?

**POST-KEYNESIAN:**

The NAIRU is a useful concept—useful for justifying unemployment as "natural" rather than as a policy choice.

Think about it: the NAIRU can't be directly observed. It's estimated after the fact. And estimates have shifted dramatically over time. In the 1990s, economists said the NAIRU was around 6 percent. Then unemployment fell to 4 percent without inflation taking off. So they revised the estimates.

A theory that gets revised every time the data contradicts it isn't much of a theory.

And here's what bothers me: the NAIRU gives policymakers permission to tolerate unemployment. "We can't push unemployment below 5 percent without inflation"—that's a political statement dressed up as economics.

**MMT:**

Exactly right. The NAIRU is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If policymakers believe it exists, they stop stimulus before reaching full employment. Then unemployment stabilizes wherever they stopped—and they call that the "natural" rate.

The Job Guarantee breaks this. With a guaranteed job for everyone who wants one at a fixed wage, you achieve genuine full employment. And because the Job Guarantee wage is fixed—not escalating—it doesn't trigger wage-price spirals.

When private demand is strong, employers hire from the Job Guarantee pool at slightly higher wages. When demand is weak, workers move into the Job Guarantee. It's a buffer stock of employed workers, rather than the current system, which uses unemployed workers as the buffer stock.

**MAINSTREAM:**

The Job Guarantee sounds great in theory. But has it ever been implemented at scale? No. We don't know if it would actually work. We don't know if government can productively employ millions of people. We don't know if the fixed wage would really anchor expectations.

I'm sympathetic to full employment goals. But you're proposing to replace proven institutions—independent central banks, inflation targeting—with an untested program.

The Great Moderation wasn't an accident. Inflation targeting delivered results for decades.

**MMT:**

The Great Moderation also delivered the 2008 financial crisis. And decades of wage stagnation for workers while asset holders got rich. And persistent unemployment that the system treated as acceptable.

Maybe we should question whether that was really success.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**MODERATOR:**

Let's talk about a concrete case: the 2008-2020 period. Central banks created trillions through quantitative easing. Monetarists predicted high inflation. It didn't arrive. What happened?

**MAINSTREAM:**

This is a fair challenge. Inflation was lower than expected for years.

Several factors explain it. The money went into bank reserves, not into circulating money. Velocity fell—people and businesses held more cash. Global supply chains kept goods prices down. And inflation expectations remained anchored because central banks maintained credibility.

It's a reminder that the transmission mechanism is complex. But it doesn't overturn the basic framework—it shows we need to model these nuances better.

**POST-KEYNESIAN:**

Or it shows the basic framework is wrong. The quantity theory says more money means higher prices. That's the core monetarist claim. If you create trillions in new money and prices don't rise, maybe the theory is just false.

What actually happened? The money went into asset prices—stocks, bonds, real estate soared. Wealth inequality exploded. But consumer price inflation stayed low because workers had no bargaining power.

The theory missed this because it treats "the price level" as one thing. But there are asset prices and consumer prices, and they can diverge massively.

**MMT:**

From an MMT perspective, there's no puzzle. Inflation comes from spending exceeding capacity. QE created bank reserves, but reserves don't buy goods and services. The economy had massive unused capacity—unemployment, slack—so there was nothing to push prices up.

The lesson is simple: money creation doesn't cause inflation. Spending beyond productive capacity causes inflation. They're not the same thing.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**MODERATOR:**

Final question: if you had to advise a policymaker facing rising inflation, what would you tell them?

**MAINSTREAM:**

Identify whether the shock is supply or demand. If it's demand, tighten monetary policy. If it's supply, be cautious—look through temporary shocks if expectations are anchored. But if there's any sign expectations are drifting, act decisively. Credibility is everything.

Above all: maintain central bank independence. Political pressure leads to inflationary mistakes.

**POST-KEYNESIAN:**

First, diagnose the cause correctly. Is this cost-push or demand-pull? Where are prices rising—energy? Housing? Food?

Then address the cause directly. If energy is driving inflation, invest in energy. If housing costs are rising, build housing. If profits are exploding, look at market power.

Don't reach for interest rates as the first tool. They're a blunt instrument that work by causing unemployment. There are better ways.

**MMT:**

Ask: is the economy at capacity? If there's unemployment and slack, inflation isn't from excess demand. Look for bottlenecks—specific sectors where supply is constrained.

Use fiscal policy strategically. Tax more if you need to drain demand. Invest in capacity where it's lacking.

Long-term, implement a Job Guarantee. It gives you full employment and price stability together—without relying on the cruel mechanism of unemployment to discipline wages.

**MODERATOR:**

Thank you all. As you can hear, economists don't just disagree about details—they disagree about fundamentals. What causes inflation, how money works, what role government should play.

These debates matter. They determine policy—whether rates rise or fall, whether governments spend or cut, who bears the burden when prices rise.

There's no easy answer, no single correct theory. But understanding the debate helps you think more clearly about what's happening in the economy and whose interests different policies serve.

Thanks for listening.
