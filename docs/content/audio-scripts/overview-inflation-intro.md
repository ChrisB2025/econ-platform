## Script

[INTRO MUSIC - 5 seconds]

**NARRATOR:**

If you've ever complained about prices going up—your rent, your groceries, your coffee—you've experienced inflation. It's one of those economics topics that affects everyone, from the teenager buying lunch to the central banker deciding interest rates.

But here's the thing: despite how common inflation is, economists fundamentally disagree about what causes it and what to do about it. And I mean *fundamentally*. Not just disagreements around the edges, but completely different theories about how the economy works.

Today, we're going to explore what inflation is, why it matters, and why smart, well-informed economists can look at the same data and reach wildly different conclusions. By the end, you won't just understand inflation better—you'll understand why economics itself is more contested than you might think.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

So, let's start with the basics. What *is* inflation?

The standard definition is: a sustained increase in the general level of prices. When inflation happens, each unit of currency—each dollar, each pound, each euro—buys less than it used to. Your money loses purchasing power.

We typically measure inflation using something called the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. Statisticians track the prices of a "basket" of goods and services that a typical household might buy—bread, gasoline, rent, haircuts, electronics—and see how that basket's total cost changes over time.

If the basket cost 100 dollars last year and 105 dollars this year, that's 5 percent inflation.

Simple enough, right?

[PAUSE - 1 second]

Well... not quite. Even at this basic level, there are disagreements.

For instance: should we include housing prices? What about the stock market? If your rent stays the same but your retirement account doubles, has your cost of living gone up or down?

And here's a deeper question: some economists—particularly those in the Austrian school—argue that we're defining inflation wrong from the start. They say inflation isn't rising prices; it's the *expansion of the money supply*. Rising prices are just a symptom.

Why does this matter? Because if you define inflation as rising prices, you might try to fight it by controlling prices. But if you define it as money expansion, you'd focus on the banking system instead.

See how even definitions aren't neutral?

[PAUSE - 1 second]

Now, let's get to the big question: What *causes* inflation?

This is where things get really interesting, because there are at least four major theories, and they point in very different directions.

[PAUSE - 0.5 seconds]

**Theory one: Too much demand.**

This is the mainstream textbook explanation. Inflation happens when there's too much spending chasing too few goods. When demand exceeds what the economy can supply, businesses raise prices because they can.

Think of concert tickets. If ten thousand people want tickets but the venue only holds five thousand, prices go up. Scale that to the whole economy, and you've got demand-pull inflation.

The solution, according to this view, is to cool demand. Central banks raise interest rates, making borrowing more expensive. People spend less, demand falls, and inflation eases.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**Theory two: Rising costs.**

This is the post-Keynesian view, and it flips the script. Inflation isn't mainly about demand—it's about costs.

When oil prices spike, everything that uses oil gets more expensive—transportation, plastics, heating. Those costs get passed on to consumers. When workers demand higher wages to keep up with living costs, businesses raise prices to maintain their profit margins. This triggers more wage demands, more price increases, and you've got a wage-price spiral.

In this view, inflation is fundamentally about conflict—workers, businesses, and governments all fighting over shares of the economic pie. When their demands add up to more than one hundred percent, something has to give, and that something is the price level.

The solution isn't raising interest rates—that just causes unemployment. Instead, you need to address the costs directly, or negotiate agreements between workers and businesses about how to share the pie.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**Theory three: Too much money.**

This is monetarism, associated with Milton Friedman. His famous line was: "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon."

The idea is simple: if the money supply grows faster than the economy's output, prices will rise. Double the money supply without doubling the goods and services available, and prices will roughly double.

The solution is equally simple in principle: control the money supply. Don't let it grow faster than the economy.

This view was hugely influential in the 1970s and 80s. But it hit problems when central banks tried to actually target money supply and found it was harder to control than expected. And after the 2008 financial crisis, central banks created trillions in new money, and... inflation stayed low for years. The predicted inflation never arrived.

Monetarists would say the money went into asset prices, or that velocity fell. Critics say the theory just doesn't hold.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

**Theory four: Real resource constraints.**

This is the ecological economics view, and it's the most different from the others.

Ecological economists point out that the economy runs on physical stuff—energy, materials, land. When these get scarce, prices rise, and no monetary policy can change that.

Every major oil shock has caused inflation. Climate change is imposing costs—damaged infrastructure, crop failures, insurance increases—that will show up as higher prices. As we deplete easy-to-access resources and move to harder-to-reach ones, costs rise.

In this view, some inflation isn't policy failure—it's the economy bumping up against physical limits. You can't print more oil.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

So we have four theories: demand-pull, cost-push, too much money, and resource constraints.

The thing is, they can all be partly right in different situations. The 1970s inflation probably involved oil shocks *and* loose monetary policy *and* wage-price spirals. The 2021-2022 inflation surge involved supply chain disruptions *and* fiscal stimulus *and* energy prices.

The debate isn't just academic. Which theory you believe determines what policies you support.

If you think demand is the problem, you support interest rate hikes.

If you think costs are the problem, you might support price controls or industrial policy.

If you think it's money supply, you want tighter monetary rules.

If you think it's resource constraints, you focus on energy transition and sustainability.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

Here's what I find fascinating: these aren't just disagreements about mechanisms. They're disagreements about how the economy fundamentally works. About what money is. About who has power. About whether markets self-correct or whether they need active management.

The mainstream view, taught in most textbooks and practiced by most central banks, tends to see inflation as manageable through interest rate policy. Trust the central bank, anchor expectations, and everything will be fine.

The heterodox views—post-Keynesian, MMT, Austrian, ecological—each challenge this in different ways. They say the mainstream is missing something important, whether that's distributional conflict, or fiscal policy's role, or credit distortion, or physical reality.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

So where does that leave you?

My suggestion: don't pick a team. At least, not yet.

Each of these perspectives has something to teach. Each explains some episodes better than others. Each has blind spots.

The goal isn't to find the one true theory. It's to understand the different lenses, so you can think more clearly about what's happening when prices rise, who's affected, and what—if anything—should be done about it.

Economics isn't physics. There aren't universal laws waiting to be discovered. There are frameworks, models, and perspectives—each illuminating something, each hiding something else.

Inflation is a perfect example. It seems simple—prices are going up. But why, and what to do about it? That depends on assumptions about how the world works. And those assumptions are contested.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

In the episodes to come, we'll dive deeper into each of these perspectives. We'll look at what they get right, what they struggle to explain, and how they critique each other.

For now, I'll leave you with this: the next time someone tells you confidently what causes inflation, ask them: which theory are you assuming? Because the answer matters more than you might think.

[PAUSE - 1 second]

Thanks for listening.
