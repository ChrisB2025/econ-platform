2. Explain at least three different theories of what causes inflation
3. Compare and contrast mainstream and heterodox perspectives on inflation
4. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different policy approaches
5. Apply different frameworks to analyze real-world inflation episodes
6. Recognize that economists fundamentally disagree about inflation's causes and cures

## Lesson 1: What Is Inflation?

### Objectives
- Define inflation and related terms
- Understand how inflation is measured
- Recognize that definition and measurement are not neutral

### Opening Activity (10 min)
Ask students: "Prices of what have gone up in your lifetime? What has gotten cheaper?" Create a list. Discuss: does this mean there's been inflation?

### Key Content (25 min)

**Definitions:**
- Inflation = sustained increase in the general price level
- Deflation = sustained decrease in the general price level
- Disinflation = slowing rate of inflation

**Measurement:**
- Consumer Price Index (CPI): basket of goods typical household buys
- Limitations: whose basket? Quality changes? Housing costs?

**Contested Ground:**
- Austrian economists argue "inflation" should mean money supply expansion, not price rises
- Asset prices (housing, stocks) often excluded—should they be?
- Who decides what goes in the basket?

### Discussion Questions (15 min)
1. Why might governments want to use a measure that shows lower inflation?
2. If your rent doubles but electronics get cheaper, how does that show up in CPI?
3. Does it matter whether we define inflation as "rising prices" or "money expansion"?

### Homework
Find three different inflation rates for the same country/period (CPI, core inflation, PCE). Why do they differ?

## Lesson 2: What Causes Inflation?

### Objectives
- Explain three theories of inflation's causes
- Understand the key assumptions behind each
- Recognize that causation is disputed

### Opening Activity (10 min)
Present a hypothetical: "Country X has 8% inflation. What questions would you ask to figure out the cause?"

### Key Content: Three Theories (30 min)

**Theory 1: Demand-Pull (Mainstream)**
- Too much spending chasing too few goods
- Mechanism: excess demand → firms raise prices
- Solution: reduce demand (higher interest rates, fiscal tightening)
- Key assumption: markets adjust through prices

**Theory 2: Cost-Push (Post-Keynesian)**
- Rising costs of production push prices up
- Mechanism: oil shock → higher transport costs → higher everything
- Or: workers demand higher wages → firms raise prices to maintain margins
- Solution: address costs directly; income policies
- Key assumption: firms set prices as markup over costs

**Theory 3: Too Much Money (Monetarist)**
- Money supply growing faster than output
- Mechanism: more money → more spending → higher prices
- Solution: control money supply growth
- Key assumption: velocity of money is stable; money supply is controllable

**Activity:** Give students three mini-case studies. In groups, apply each theory. Which fits best?

### Discussion (10 min)
- Can all three be right in different circumstances?
- How would you tell which theory is correct?
- What evidence would change your mind?

## Lesson 3: Deep Dive—Heterodox Perspectives

### Objectives
- Understand Austrian, MMT, and ecological views on inflation
- Compare these to mainstream perspectives
- Evaluate assumptions critically

### Opening Activity (5 min)
"The mainstream view says central banks should raise interest rates to fight inflation. Not everyone agrees. Let's explore alternatives."

### Austrian Perspective (10 min)
- Focus: credit expansion, not just money supply
- Problem: artificially low interest rates cause malinvestment
- Solution: stop manipulating interest rates; "sound money"
- Critique of mainstream: you're treating symptoms, not causes

### MMT Perspective (10 min)
- Focus: spending relative to real productive capacity
- Problem isn't money—it's hitting real resource limits
- Solution: fiscal policy, taxation, Job Guarantee
- Critique of mainstream: deficits don't cause inflation; interest rates are poor tool

### Ecological Perspective (10 min)
- Focus: physical resources, energy, environment
- Problem: some inflation reflects real scarcity that policy can't fix
- Solution: transition to sustainable economy; accept some price signals
- Critique of mainstream: ignores biophysical reality

### Comparative Discussion (15 min)
Create a table on the board with students:

| School | What causes inflation? | Who/what is to blame? | What should be done? |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Mainstream | Excess demand | Various | Interest rates |
| Monetarist | Money growth | Central bank | Money rules |
| Austrian | Credit expansion | Central bank | End intervention |
| Post-Keynesian | Cost/conflict | Various | Income policy |
| MMT | Spend > capacity | Excessive spending | Fiscal policy |
| Ecological | Resource limits | Physical reality | Steady-state economy |

## Lesson 4: Case Study—The 2021-2023 Inflation

### Objectives
- Apply multiple frameworks to a real event
- Evaluate competing explanations
- Develop evidence-based judgment

### Background (10 min)
Present the facts:
- COVID-19 disrupted supply chains globally
- Governments provided fiscal support (stimulus checks, business support)
- Central banks held interest rates low, engaged in QE
- Inflation surged in 2021-22 across many countries
- Energy prices spiked further after Russia's invasion of Ukraine
- Central banks raised interest rates aggressively in 2022-23
- Inflation has since declined

### Group Activity (25 min)
Divide class into six groups, each assigned a school of thought. Each group must:
1. Explain this inflation from their school's perspective
2. Identify what evidence supports their view
3. Identify what their view struggles to explain
4. Recommend what policy should have been

### Presentation and Debate (15 min)
Each group presents (2 min each). Then open discussion:
- Which explanation do you find most convincing? Why?
- Could multiple factors be at work?
- What would have happened with different policies?

### Synthesis
Teacher draws together insights: this episode likely involved multiple factors (supply disruption, fiscal stimulus, energy shock, corporate pricing). Different schools emphasize different factors. The "right" answer may depend on which country and which period you're looking at.

## Assessment Options

### Option A: Essay
"Economists disagree about what causes inflation. Compare and contrast two different explanations of inflation's causes, evaluate the evidence for each, and explain which you find more convincing and why." (750-1000 words)

### Option B: Case Study Analysis
Provide data on a specific inflation episode (e.g., 1970s stagflation, Japan's deflation, Argentina). Students analyze using at least two different frameworks.

### Option C: Policy Debate
Students prepare and conduct a debate: "This house believes the Federal Reserve was right to raise interest rates aggressively in 2022." Teams must use economic arguments from multiple schools.

## Differentiation

### For Advanced Students
- Read excerpts from primary sources (Friedman, Mises, Kelton)
- Engage with empirical debates about velocity stability, endogenous money
- Consider mathematical models (quantity equation, Phillips curve)

### For Students Needing Support
- Focus on two frameworks rather than all six
- Use more visual representations and concrete examples
- Provide structured note-taking templates

---

## Materials Needed

- Access to inflation data (FRED, BLS, World Bank)
- Case study handouts
- Discussion question cards
- Comparison table templates
- Access to platform content (school-by-school explanations)
