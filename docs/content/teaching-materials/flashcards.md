## Basic Definitions

### Card 1
**Front:** What is inflation?
**Back:** A sustained increase in the general level of prices, meaning each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services over time.

### Card 2
**Front:** What is deflation?
**Back:** A sustained decrease in the general level of prices, meaning each unit of currency buys more goods and services over time.

### Card 3
**Front:** What is disinflation?
**Back:** A slowing in the rate of inflation—prices are still rising, but more slowly than before.

### Card 4
**Front:** What is the Consumer Price Index (CPI)?
**Back:** A measure of inflation that tracks the cost of a representative basket of goods and services that typical households purchase.

### Card 5
**Front:** What is the difference between "headline" and "core" inflation?
**Back:** Headline inflation includes all prices. Core inflation excludes volatile items like food and energy to show underlying trends.

## Schools of Thought: Core Claims

### Card 6
**Front:** According to the mainstream/neoclassical view, what primarily causes inflation?
**Back:** Aggregate demand exceeding aggregate supply, combined with expectations becoming unanchored.

### Card 7
**Front:** Complete Friedman's famous statement: "Inflation is always and everywhere a _____ phenomenon."
**Back:** "Monetary phenomenon"—meaning inflation is fundamentally caused by money supply growing faster than output.

### Card 8
**Front:** According to the Austrian school, what is inflation properly defined as?
**Back:** Expansion of the money supply (particularly credit). Rising prices are a consequence, not inflation itself.

### Card 9
**Front:** According to post-Keynesians, what primarily causes inflation?
**Back:** Cost pressures (rising input costs) and distributional conflict between workers, firms, and government over shares of income.

### Card 10
**Front:** According to MMT, when does inflation occur?
**Back:** When spending (public or private) exceeds the economy's real productive capacity—when there are no more workers, materials, or capacity to hire.

### Card 11
**Front:** According to ecological economists, what is an important but overlooked cause of inflation?
**Back:** Biophysical resource constraints—energy depletion, resource scarcity, and environmental limits that monetary policy cannot overcome.

## Key Concepts

### Card 12
**Front:** What is the Phillips curve?
**Back:** A concept showing an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation—when unemployment is low, inflation tends to be high, and vice versa.

### Card 13
**Front:** What is the NAIRU?
**Back:** The Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment—the unemployment rate below which inflation is supposed to accelerate. Mainstream view says it's real; heterodox economists call it a myth.

### Card 14
**Front:** What is "demand-pull" inflation?
**Back:** Inflation caused by excessive demand—too much spending chasing too few goods, causing firms to raise prices.

### Card 15
**Front:** What is "cost-push" inflation?
**Back:** Inflation caused by rising production costs (oil, wages, materials) being passed on to consumers as higher prices.

### Card 16
**Front:** What is "endogenous money"?
**Back:** The idea that money is created within the economic system by bank lending, rather than being controlled externally by the central bank.

### Card 17
**Front:** What is the "Cantillon effect"?
**Back:** The phenomenon where new money benefits early recipients (banks, government) who can spend it before prices rise, at the expense of late recipients (workers) who receive it after prices have risen.

### Card 18
**Front:** What is the quantity theory of money?
**Back:** The equation MV = PQ (money × velocity = prices × output), suggesting that changes in money supply cause proportional changes in the price level.

### Card 19
**Front:** What is "malinvestment" in Austrian economics?
**Back:** Investment in projects that seem profitable only because of artificially low interest rates but are not sustainable when rates return to their "natural" level.

### Card 20
**Front:** What is the Job Guarantee in MMT?
**Back:** A program where government offers employment to anyone who wants it at a fixed wage, aiming to achieve full employment while the fixed wage acts as a price anchor.

## Policy Concepts

### Card 21
**Front:** What is inflation targeting?
**Back:** A monetary policy framework where the central bank aims to keep inflation at a specific target (usually 2%) by adjusting interest rates.

### Card 22
**Front:** What is the Taylor Rule?
**Back:** A guideline for setting interest rates: raise rates when inflation exceeds target or when output exceeds potential; lower rates in the opposite cases.

### Card 23
**Front:** Why do mainstream economists argue central banks should be independent?
**Back:** To insulate monetary policy from political pressure—politicians might want short-term stimulus that causes long-term inflation, while independent central banks can focus on price stability.

### Card 24
**Front:** What is "fiscal dominance"?
**Back:** A situation where government fiscal policy (deficits, debt) forces the central bank to accommodate by creating money, potentially causing inflation.

### Card 25
**Front:** What are "income policies"?
**Back:** Government policies that aim to control inflation by coordinating or directly managing wages and prices, rather than using interest rates.

## Historical Events

### Card 26
**Front:** What was "stagflation" in the 1970s?
**Back:** A period when inflation and unemployment were both high simultaneously—contradicting the Phillips curve trade-off that mainstream economics expected.

### Card 27
**Front:** What was the "Volcker disinflation"?
**Back:** When Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker raised interest rates dramatically in 1979-82 to break inflation, causing a severe recession but bringing inflation down from double digits to around 4%.

### Card 28
**Front:** What was the "Great Moderation"?
**Back:** The period from roughly 1985 to 2007 when inflation and economic volatility were low in developed economies, often attributed to improved central bank policies.

### Card 29
**Front:** What was quantitative easing (QE)?
**Back:** Central banks creating money to buy financial assets (especially government bonds), used extensively after 2008 and during COVID-19.

### Card 30
**Front:** Why is Japan's experience often cited in inflation debates?
**Back:** Japan ran large deficits for decades with enormous government debt but experienced deflation/low inflation—challenging the view that deficits cause inflation.

## Critical Thinking

### Card 31
**Front:** What evidence would challenge the monetarist view?
**Back:** Periods of rapid money supply growth without corresponding inflation (like 2008-2020), or inflation occurring without money supply growth. Instability of velocity.

### Card 32
**Front:** What evidence would challenge the post-Keynesian view?
**Back:** Inflation occurring clearly from excess demand without cost pressures, or income policies consistently failing to control inflation.

### Card 33
**Front:** What is the main MMT critique of fighting inflation with interest rate increases?
**Back:** Higher rates redistribute to bondholders (potentially inflationary), hurt debtors (regressive), work only by causing unemployment (cruel), and interest is a cost of production (directly inflationary).

### Card 34
**Front:** Why do Austrians say CPI understates the damage from inflation?
**Back:** Because CPI tracks consumer prices while the real distortion is in relative prices and capital structure. Asset price inflation and malinvestment don't show up in CPI.

### Card 35
**Front:** What do ecological economists say that other schools miss?
**Back:** That some inflation reflects genuine resource scarcity and biophysical limits that no monetary or fiscal policy can overcome—the economy can't transcend physics.

## Quotes to Remember

### Card 36
**Front:** Who said "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"?
**Back:** Milton Friedman, the leading monetarist economist.

### Card 37
**Front:** Who said "In the long run we are all dead"?
**Back:** John Maynard Keynes, arguing that economic policy must consider short-run effects, not just long-run equilibrium.

### Card 38
**Front:** Who wrote *The Deficit Myth*?
**Back:** Stephanie Kelton, an MMT economist, arguing that deficit fears are misguided for currency-issuing governments.

### Card 39
**Front:** Who developed Austrian Business Cycle Theory?
**Back:** Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek, explaining boom-bust cycles through credit expansion.

### Card 40
**Front:** Who said "Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist"?
**Back:** Kenneth Boulding, an early ecological economist.
