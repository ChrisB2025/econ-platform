## Short Answer Questions

**14.** Explain the difference between "exogenous" and "endogenous" money. Which schools of thought hold each view, and why does it matter for inflation policy? (150-200 words)

**Model Answer:** Exogenous money means the central bank controls the money supply from outside the economic system—it decides how much money exists. Monetarists assume this view; it underlies the quantity theory of money and supports money supply targeting.

Endogenous money means money is created within the economic system by bank lending—when banks make loans, they create deposits. The money supply expands to meet demand from businesses and households. Post-Keynesians and MMT hold this view.

This matters because if money is exogenous, controlling money supply controls inflation (monetarist prescription). But if money is endogenous, the central bank can't control the money supply directly—it can only set the interest rate (price of credit). This shifts the policy focus from money quantity to credit conditions and, for MMT/post-Keynesians, to fiscal policy and income policies as more effective tools.

Empirically, central banks abandoned money supply targeting in the 1980s because they couldn't reliably control it—suggesting money is at least partly endogenous.

**15.** What is the "Cantillon effect" and why do Austrian economists consider it important? (100-150 words)

**Model Answer:** The Cantillon effect describes how new money enters the economy unevenly. When the central bank creates money, it flows first to banks and financial institutions, then to their clients, and only gradually to the broader economy. Early recipients can spend the new money before prices adjust, gaining real purchasing power. By the time ordinary workers receive the money through wages, prices have already risen.

Austrians consider this important because it shows inflation isn't just a general price increase—it's a systematic redistribution from late recipients (typically workers and those on fixed incomes) to early recipients (banks, government, financial sector). This makes inflation a kind of hidden, regressive tax that aggregate measures like CPI don't capture.

**16.** Compare the mainstream and post-Keynesian explanations for the 1970s stagflation. (150-200 words)

**Model Answer:** Stagflation (simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment) challenged the Phillips curve trade-off that mainstream economics expected.

**Mainstream explanation:** The oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 were supply shocks that shifted the aggregate supply curve, causing both higher prices and lower output. Additionally, monetary policy had been too loose, and inflation expectations became unanchored. The experience led to the expectations-augmented Phillips curve and the concept of the NAIRU.

**Post-Keynesian explanation:** Stagflation demonstrates that inflation can be cost-push, not demand-pull. The oil shocks raised costs throughout the economy, causing firms to raise prices regardless of demand conditions. Distributional conflict intensified as workers sought to maintain living standards through wage increases. The result was a wage-price spiral driven by costs and conflict, not excess demand.

The key difference: mainstream sees the oil shock as a temporary disruption to a demand-driven system; post-Keynesians see it as evidence that cost-push and conflict are primary drivers of inflation.
