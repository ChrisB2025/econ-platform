# Discussion Questions: Inflation Module

## Foundational Questions

### Definition and Measurement

1. **Why does the definition of inflation matter?** Austrian economists define inflation as expansion of the money supply, while others define it as rising prices. How might these different definitions lead to different policy conclusions?

2. **What should be in the inflation basket?** The CPI tracks prices of goods and services typical households buy—but housing is measured controversially, and assets like stocks aren't included at all. Should asset prices be part of inflation? Why might governments prefer measures that exclude them?

3. **Is there such a thing as "true" inflation?** If the price of computers falls while the price of healthcare rises, is there a meaningful sense in which "the price level" has changed? Or is all inflation just relative price changes in disguise?

## Causes of Inflation

### Demand vs. Supply

4. **How would you tell demand-pull from cost-push inflation?** If prices are rising, what evidence would indicate whether the cause is too much demand or rising costs? Is it possible to separate these in practice?

5. **Can inflation happen without excess demand?** Post-Keynesians argue that cost pressures can drive inflation even when there's unemployment and slack in the economy. Mainstream economists tend to see demand as primary. What evidence would settle this debate?

6. **Is inflation "always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"?** Milton Friedman's famous claim implies money supply is the key variable. What would disprove this? Has the 2008-2020 experience (massive QE with little inflation) disproven it?

### Money and Credit

7. **Does money cause inflation, or does inflation cause money?** If the money supply expands because banks are lending to meet business demand, and then prices rise, which came first? How would you determine the direction of causality?

8. **Is money "exogenous" or "endogenous"?** Monetarists assume central banks control the money supply. Post-Keynesians argue banks create money by lending, and central banks accommodate. What evidence supports each view?

9. **Why did massive quantitative easing after 2008 not cause inflation?** Central banks created trillions in new money. The quantity theory predicts this should have caused inflation. It didn't. What happened?

## Policy Questions

### Central Banks and Interest Rates

10. **Do higher interest rates reduce inflation?** The mainstream view says yes—by reducing demand. Critics argue rates are a cost of production and can be inflationary. Rate increases also transfer income to bondholders (often wealthy). Do the costs of rate increases exceed the benefits?

11. **Should central banks be independent?** Independence is supposed to protect against inflationary pressure from politicians. But should unelected officials make decisions about unemployment? Who should decide the trade-offs?

12. **Is the NAIRU real?** Mainstream economics says there's a "natural" rate of unemployment below which inflation accelerates. Post-Keynesians call this a myth. The concept justifies accepting unemployment as necessary. Is it based on evidence or ideology?

### Fiscal Policy and Inflation

13. **Do government deficits cause inflation?** MMT argues that deficits only cause inflation when spending exceeds real productive capacity. Mainstream view worries about "fiscal dominance." What historical evidence supports each side?

14. **Should taxes be used to fight inflation?** MMT proposes using taxation as an inflation-fighting tool rather than interest rates. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

15. **Would a Job Guarantee cause inflation?** MMT proposes guaranteeing employment to all who want it at a fixed wage. Critics say this would be inflationary. Proponents say the fixed wage anchors prices. Who's right?

## Distributional Questions

16. **Who wins and who loses from inflation?** Debtors tend to benefit (they repay in cheaper dollars). Creditors tend to lose. Workers on fixed wages lose. Asset holders may gain or lose depending on the asset. How should these distributional effects influence policy?

17. **Who wins and who loses from fighting inflation?** When central banks raise rates to reduce inflation, they typically cause unemployment. Is it fair that workers bear the cost of fighting inflation while asset holders are protected?

18. **Is inflation a form of hidden tax?** Austrians argue that money creation redistributes from late recipients (workers) to early recipients (banks, government contractors). Is this a fair characterization? Is it different from explicit taxation?

## Historical Case Studies

### The 1970s Stagflation

19. **What caused 1970s stagflation?** Inflation and unemployment rose together, contradicting the Phillips curve. Was it oil shocks? Loose monetary policy? Union wage demands? Poor luck or bad policy?

20. **Was Volcker right to cause a recession?** Fed Chair Volcker raised interest rates dramatically in 1979-82, causing a severe recession but breaking inflation. Was this the right choice? Were there alternatives?

### The 2021-2023 Inflation

21. **What caused the 2021-2023 inflation surge?** COVID supply disruptions? Fiscal stimulus (the "stimmies")? Energy prices? Corporate greed? How would each school of thought explain it?

22. **Did the Fed respond correctly in 2022-23?** The Fed raised rates aggressively. Critics say this was unnecessary (supply was recovering) and harmful (caused layoffs, bank failures). Supporters say it anchored expectations. Who's right?

23. **What does the fact that inflation declined prove?** Did inflation fall because of rate increases or despite them? As supply chains normalized, was Fed policy necessary or coincidental? What would we expect to see under each theory?

### Hyperinflation

24. **What really causes hyperinflation?** Simple narrative: government prints too much money. Alternative: productive capacity collapses, and money printing is a symptom, not a cause. What does the evidence from Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, or Venezuela actually show?

## Big Picture Questions

25. **Is some inflation acceptable?** Most central banks target 2% inflation. Why not zero? Why not 4%? Is there a "right" amount of inflation?

26. **Is inflation fear overblown?** Some argue that moderate inflation is not harmful and that the fear of inflation has been used to justify austerity and unemployment. Is there merit to this view?

27. **Does the mainstream view have an ideological bias?** Heterodox economists argue that mainstream theory justifies the status quo: unemployment is "natural," deficits are dangerous, central banks know best. Is this a fair critique?

28. **What would convince you that a school of thought is wrong?** For each major school, identify what evidence or events would falsify their claims about inflation. Is their theory testable?

29. **Why do smart people disagree about inflation?** If economics is a science, why don't economists converge on answers? What does persistent disagreement tell us about the nature of economic knowledge?

30. **What do you believe—and why?** After studying multiple perspectives, which school's explanation of inflation do you find most convincing? What evidence or arguments moved you? What questions remain?

## Discussion Guidelines

When discussing these questions:

- **Steel-man before critiquing.** Present the strongest version of a view before criticizing it.
- **Follow the evidence.** What empirical facts support or challenge each position?
- **Distinguish types of claims.** Is the disagreement about facts, values, or definitions?
- **Consider your priors.** What did you believe before this class? Has that changed?
- **Tolerate ambiguity.** Not every question has a clear answer. That's okay.
