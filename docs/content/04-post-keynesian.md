# The Post-Keynesian View: Inflation as Cost-Push and Distributional Conflict

## The Core Idea

Post-Keynesian economics offers a fundamentally different account of inflation than the mainstream story of "too much money chasing too few goods." For post-Keynesians, inflation is primarily a **cost-push** phenomenon, driven by rising production costs and conflicts over the distribution of income. It's not mainly about demand—it's about power.

Who has the power to raise their prices or wages? And who is forced to accept the increases imposed by others? Inflation, in this view, reflects the ongoing struggle between workers seeking higher wages, firms seeking higher profits, and governments extracting taxes. When these claims on the economic pie add up to more than 100%, something has to give—and that something is the price level.

This framework traces its lineage to Keynes himself (interpreted differently than by the mainstream), as well as to Michal Kalecki, Joan Robinson, and other economists who emphasized uncertainty, institutions, and class conflict in capitalist economies.

## How Inflation Happens

Post-Keynesians identify several mechanisms:

**Conflict inflation (the wage-price spiral):**
1. Workers demand higher wages to maintain their living standards
2. Firms, facing higher labor costs, raise prices to protect their profit margins
3. Higher prices erode workers' real wages, prompting further wage demands
4. The spiral continues unless some group accepts a reduction in their share

This isn't about "too much demand"—it's about incompatible claims on income. If workers want a 5% raise, firms want to maintain 15% profit margins, and the government needs 30% in taxes, but the economy can only produce so much, something doesn't add up. The result is rising prices.

**Cost-push from imported inputs:**
When oil prices spike, or commodity prices rise, or supply chains break down, the costs of production increase. Firms pass these costs on to consumers. This kind of inflation has nothing to do with demand exceeding supply—it's about inputs becoming more expensive.

**Profit-push inflation:**
Firms with market power can raise prices beyond what cost increases would justify. When industries are concentrated and competition is weak, firms can increase their markups—their profit margins—contributing to inflation independently of wage pressures.

**A crucial point about money:**
Post-Keynesians argue that money is **endogenous**—it's created by bank lending, not controlled by the central bank. When firms need credit to finance production, banks create money by crediting borrowers' accounts. The money supply expands to accommodate economic activity; it doesn't cause it. This reverses the mainstream causal story: inflation doesn't come from "too much money," rather the money supply adjusts to accommodate inflationary pressures.

## Why Interest Rate Policy Is Problematic

If inflation is primarily cost-push, raising interest rates is a crude and often counterproductive tool:

- **It works (when it does) by causing recession.** Higher rates reduce demand, which increases unemployment, which weakens workers' bargaining power, which suppresses wages. But the "cure" is a recession—hardly a triumph of policy.

- **It can be directly inflationary.** Interest is a cost of production for firms carrying debt. Raise rates, and you raise their costs—potentially adding to cost-push inflation.

- **It redistributes from debtors to creditors.** Higher rates benefit those who own financial assets (typically the wealthy) at the expense of those who owe money (often working and middle-class households).

- **It doesn't address the underlying conflict.** If inflation stems from incompatible claims on income, suppressing one group (workers) through unemployment doesn't resolve the underlying tension—it just determines who loses.

## Policy Prescriptions

Post-Keynesians advocate tools that mainstream economics often dismisses:

**Income policies and wage coordination.** If inflation results from distributional conflict, address the conflict directly. Negotiate agreements between labor, business, and government to coordinate wage growth with productivity growth, so no group needs to grab a larger share through price or wage increases.

**Industrial policy for supply capacity.** If bottlenecks cause cost-push inflation (not enough housing, not enough energy, not enough of key inputs), build more capacity. Address the real constraints rather than suppressing demand.

**Fiscal policy for full employment.** Use government spending and job creation to maintain full employment. The mainstream view that low unemployment causes inflation (via NAIRU) is challenged—post-Keynesians argue the NAIRU is not a real constraint but a policy choice.

**Address market power.** If concentrated industries are pushing prices up to boost profits, use antitrust policy, regulation, or public alternatives to discipline pricing power.

**Keep interest rates low and stable.** Rather than using interest rates as the primary policy lever, keep them low (reducing costs and inequality) and use fiscal and incomes policies for stabilization.

## Strengths of This View

- **Explains stagflation.** The 1970s saw inflation and unemployment rise together—"stagflation." The mainstream Phillips curve said this couldn't happen. Post-Keynesian cost-push theory explained it: oil shocks and distributional conflict could cause inflation even with high unemployment.

- **Explains the 2021-2023 inflation.** The recent inflation surge began with supply disruptions (COVID shutdowns, shipping costs, energy prices from the Ukraine war). Corporate profits increased substantially, suggesting profit-push dynamics. This fits cost-push theory better than demand-pull.

- **Empirical support for endogenous money.** Research from central banks themselves (including a notable 2014 Bank of England paper) confirms that money is created by lending, not controlled from above. Attempts to target monetary aggregates failed in the 1980s precisely because money is endogenous.

- **Highlights power and distribution.** By focusing on who has pricing power and bargaining strength, post-Keynesian analysis connects inflation to broader questions of inequality, labor relations, and corporate concentration.

## Limitations and Critiques

- **Income policies have a mixed record.** Wage and price controls have often broken down under pressure, creating distortions or black markets. They require strong institutions and social consensus to work.

- **The theory is less precise than mainstream.** Without a NAIRU or clear anchor, it's harder to make quantitative predictions. "It depends on institutions and power" is accurate but less actionable.

- **Coordination is hard.** Getting labor, business, and government to cooperate requires political conditions that may not exist in many countries—particularly those with weak unions or adversarial labor relations.

- **Demand can matter.** While emphasizing cost-push, post-Keynesians don't deny that excessive demand can cause inflation in some circumstances. The question is whether it's the primary mechanism—post-Keynesians say usually not, but critics argue they underweight demand factors.

## Key Figures

- **John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)**: The foundational thinker, though mainstream and post-Keynesians interpret him differently
- **Michal Kalecki (1899-1970)**: Developed theories of markup pricing, profit determination, and the political economy of full employment
- **Joan Robinson (1903-1983)**: Cambridge economist who advanced post-Keynesian capital and growth theory
- **Nicholas Kaldor (1908-1986)**: Developed cost-push inflation theory and advised governments on incomes policy
- **Marc Lavoie**: Contemporary post-Keynesian who has synthesized the tradition in comprehensive textbooks

## A Different Question

Mainstream economics asks: "How can central banks keep inflation at 2%?" Post-Keynesians ask: "Whose incomes are being squeezed to achieve that target, and is there a better way?"

This reframing matters. If inflation is fundamentally about distributional conflict, then controlling it by weakening workers (through unemployment) is a political choice, not a technical necessity. There may be other ways—if we're willing to address the underlying conflicts directly.
