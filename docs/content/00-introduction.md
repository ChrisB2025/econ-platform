# Inflation: An Introduction

## What Is Inflation?

Inflation is a sustained increase in the general level of prices across an economy. When inflation occurs, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than before—in other words, the purchasing power of money falls. If a basket of groceries cost $100 last year and costs $105 this year, that 5% increase reflects inflation.

Most countries measure inflation using price indices like the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the cost of a representative basket of goods and services that households typically buy. Central banks and governments watch these numbers closely because inflation affects nearly every aspect of economic life: the value of savings, the burden of debt, the cost of doing business, and the standard of living for ordinary people.

## Why Inflation Matters

Inflation is not just a technical statistic—it is deeply political and personally felt. Rising prices can erode wages, punish savers, and create uncertainty that makes long-term planning difficult. At the same time, some argue that moderate inflation is a normal feature of a healthy, growing economy, and that the fear of inflation can lead to policies that cause unnecessary unemployment and hardship.

The distributional effects of inflation are significant: debtors may benefit (as they repay loans with less valuable currency), while creditors and those on fixed incomes may suffer. Businesses face uncertainty about future costs and prices. Governments see their tax revenues and spending obligations shift in complex ways. Understanding who gains and who loses from inflation—and from the policies used to control it—is essential to understanding modern economic debates.

## A Contested Topic

Here is what makes inflation particularly interesting to study: economists fundamentally disagree about what causes it and what should be done about it. The explanations offered by different schools of economic thought diverge sharply, and these disagreements have major implications for policy.

Some economists argue that inflation is primarily a monetary phenomenon—too much money chasing too few goods. Others emphasize cost pressures: rising wages, energy prices, or supply chain disruptions pushing up the cost of production. Still others point to conflict between different groups in society—workers, firms, and governments—each trying to claim a larger share of the economic pie. And some argue that deeper factors—like the depletion of natural resources or the limits of the physical environment—create inflationary pressures that no monetary policy can overcome.

This module presents each of these perspectives in its strongest form, examines the evidence and arguments for each, and lets you draw your own conclusions about which frameworks best explain the inflationary episodes we observe in the real world.
