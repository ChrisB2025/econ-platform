# The Austrian View: Inflation as Credit Expansion and Price Distortion

## The Core Idea

The Austrian school offers a distinctive perspective that challenges how we even define inflation. For Austrian economists, inflation isn't primarily about rising consumer prices—it's about the expansion of money and credit beyond what genuine savings would support. Rising prices are a symptom, a consequence of this deeper monetary distortion.

This view emerges from Austrian Business Cycle Theory, developed by Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. When banks create money through lending—enabled and encouraged by central bank policy—they inject artificial purchasing power into the economy. This distorts interest rates and price signals, leading businesses to make investments that seem profitable but aren't sustainable. The inevitable correction brings recession, revealing the mistakes made during the boom.

Austrians argue that focusing on aggregate measures like the Consumer Price Index misses the real damage inflation causes: the distortion of relative prices, the misallocation of capital, and the redistribution of wealth toward those who receive new money first.

## How Inflation Happens

The Austrian mechanism begins with the banking system:

1. **Credit expansion**: The central bank lowers interest rates or provides reserves that enable banks to lend more. Through fractional reserve banking, banks create new money when they make loans—money that doesn't correspond to anyone's genuine savings.

2. **Interest rate distortion**: The expanded credit pushes interest rates below their "natural" level—the rate that would balance the supply of savings with the demand for investment. This sends a false signal to businesses.

3. **Malinvestment**: Fooled by artificially cheap credit, entrepreneurs undertake long-term investment projects that would not be profitable at the true interest rate. Resources flow into the wrong activities—housing construction, capital-intensive industries, speculative ventures.

4. **The boom**: The economy appears healthy. Asset prices rise. Employment increases. But the structure of production is becoming increasingly misaligned with actual consumer preferences.

5. **The bust**: Eventually the credit expansion must slow—perhaps inflation becomes too obvious, or banks become cautious, or the central bank tightens. Interest rates rise toward their natural level. The malinvestments are revealed as unprofitable. Businesses fail. Unemployment rises. Asset prices collapse.

This bust is not a market failure—it's the necessary correction of previous distortions caused by monetary manipulation.

## The Cantillon Effect

Austrians emphasize that new money doesn't enter the economy evenly. Named after 18th-century economist Richard Cantillon, the "Cantillon effect" describes how those who receive new money first benefit at the expense of those who receive it later.

When the central bank creates money, it flows first to banks and financial institutions, then to their clients, and only gradually to the broader economy. Early recipients can spend the new money before prices adjust. By the time ordinary workers and consumers receive the money (as wages or benefits), prices have already risen. The result is a systematic transfer of purchasing power from late recipients to early recipients—typically from workers to the financial sector.

This is why Austrians view inflation as a hidden tax, and why they're skeptical that aggregate price indices capture what's really happening.

## Policy Prescriptions

Austrian prescriptions are radical compared to mainstream economics:

**Stop the credit expansion.** The fundamental solution is to end the artificial manipulation of money and credit. Central banks should not manipulate interest rates—let the market discover the natural rate through genuine saving and borrowing.

**Ideally, abolish central banking.** Many Austrians view the central bank itself as the problem. Without a lender of last resort, banks would be more cautious about lending. Competition among currencies would discipline money creation.

**Return to sound money.** Some Austrians advocate returning to a gold standard or other commodity-based money that cannot be expanded at will. Others favor "free banking"—competing private currencies without a central monopoly.

**Allow the recession to correct errors.** Bailouts and stimulus only delay the necessary correction. Recessions, though painful, are the process by which misallocated resources move to more productive uses. Propping up failing businesses prevents the economy from healing.

## Strengths of This View

- **Explains asset bubbles**: The Austrian framework explains phenomena that puzzle mainstream economics—why do we see recurring patterns of boom and bust in housing, stocks, and other assets? Austrians say: follow the credit.

- **Predicted the 2008 crisis**: Many Austrians warned that years of low interest rates and easy credit were fueling an unsustainable housing bubble. The crash vindicated their concerns about credit-driven booms.

- **Highlights distributional effects**: While mainstream economics focuses on aggregates, Austrians draw attention to who benefits from money creation—and it's not ordinary workers.

- **Captures what CPI misses**: When central banks flood the economy with money and consumer price inflation stays low, where does the money go? Into asset prices—stocks, bonds, real estate. Austrians argue this is still inflation, even if it doesn't show up in the CPI.

- **Intellectual coherence**: The theory connects monetary policy to capital structure, business cycles, and distribution in a unified framework.

## Limitations and Critiques

- **Timing is uncertain**: Austrian theory predicts that credit expansion will lead to bust, but not when. This makes the theory hard to test—any date can be explained after the fact.

- **The natural rate is unobservable**: If we can't measure the natural interest rate, how do we know when it's been distorted? Austrians respond that this is precisely the point—only markets can discover it.

- **Deflation concerns**: Critics argue that a gold standard or tight money would be deflationary as the economy grows, and that deflation can be deeply harmful (debt becomes harder to repay, spending is postponed).

- **Political impracticality**: Abolishing central banks, returning to gold, or allowing deep recessions without intervention lacks democratic support. Even if Austrian analysis is correct, the policy prescriptions may be impossible to implement.

- **The Great Depression**: Some argue that the severity of the 1930s Depression shows what happens when Austrian prescriptions are followed—tight money and no bailouts led to prolonged misery. Austrians counter that the Depression was caused by prior credit expansion and prolonged by government intervention.

## Key Figures

- **Friedrich Hayek (1899-1992)**: Further developed the business cycle theory in *Prices and Production*; won the Nobel Prize in 1974
- **Murray Rothbard (1926-1995)**: Applied Austrian theory to American economic history in *America's Great Depression*

## A Different Way of Thinking

Austrian economics asks different questions than the mainstream. Rather than "what is the optimal inflation rate?" Austrians ask "what is money creation doing to the structure of the economy?" Rather than "how can central banks stabilize prices?" they ask "why do we have central banks at all?"

This makes Austrian economics both illuminating and frustrating—illuminating because it highlights dynamics that other frameworks miss, frustrating because its policy conclusions are so far outside the current consensus.
