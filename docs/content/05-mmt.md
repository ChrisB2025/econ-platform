# The MMT View: Inflation as Spending Beyond Real Capacity

## The Core Idea

Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) offers a distinctive analysis of inflation grounded in how modern currency systems actually work. The central insight is this: for a government that issues its own currency (like the US, UK, Japan, or Australia), the constraint on spending is not money—it's **real resources**.

A currency-issuing government can always create more of its own money. It cannot run out of dollars, pounds, or yen. But it can run out of workers, factories, raw materials, and energy. When government spending (or private spending) tries to purchase more than the economy can actually produce, the result is inflation.

This may sound like standard "demand-pull" inflation, but MMT's framing differs crucially. Mainstream economics treats government budgets like household budgets—you need income (taxes) before you can spend, and deficits are potentially dangerous. MMT inverts this: the government spends first, creating money, and taxes later, removing money from circulation. Taxes don't fund spending; they help control inflation by draining purchasing power from the economy.

This reframes the entire debate about government budgets from "can we afford it?" to "do we have the real resources?"

## How Inflation Happens

In the MMT framework:

1. **Spending creates demand.** When the government spends (on infrastructure, healthcare, defense, or anything else), it adds purchasing power to the economy. Private spending (by businesses and households, often financed by bank lending) does the same.

2. **The economy responds by producing.** As long as there are unemployed workers, idle factories, and available materials, increased spending puts those resources to work. Output rises without inflation.

3. **The constraint is real capacity.** When spending exceeds what the economy can actually produce—when there are no more workers to hire, no more factory capacity, no more raw materials available—then additional spending simply bids up prices. This is inflation.

4. **Deficits add to private wealth.** When the government runs a deficit (spends more than it taxes), the difference stays in the private sector as financial savings. This isn't inherently inflationary—it depends on whether the economy has spare capacity.

## Taxes and Inflation Control

In the MMT view, taxes serve several purposes—but funding government spending isn't one of them:

- **Creating demand for the currency:** People need government currency to pay taxes. This is what gives fiat money value in the first place.
- **Controlling inflation:** By removing purchasing power from the economy, taxes cool demand. If inflation threatens, increasing taxes (or reducing spending) can drain excess spending.
- **Reducing inequality:** Progressive taxes can limit the concentration of wealth that might otherwise bid up prices for scarce goods (housing, education, status goods).
- **Discouraging harmful activities:** Taxes on carbon, tobacco, or speculation can reduce unwanted behavior.

What taxes don't do is "pay for" government spending in a financial sense. The government doesn't need your tax dollars before it can spend—operationally, it spends by crediting bank accounts and taxes by debiting them.

## The Job Guarantee

A centerpiece of MMT's approach to inflation is the **Job Guarantee**: a public option for employment at a fixed wage.

Here's how it works:

1. The government offers a job to anyone who wants one, at a set wage (say, $15/hour plus benefits).
2. This eliminates involuntary unemployment—anyone who wants work can have it.
3. In a downturn, workers flow into the Job Guarantee pool. In an upturn, private employers hire them away.
4. The fixed Job Guarantee wage acts as an anchor for wages throughout the economy.

The genius of this approach, MMT proponents argue, is that it achieves genuine full employment without triggering a wage-price spiral. The Job Guarantee wage doesn't compete upward like unemployment benefits or minimum wage increases—it provides a floor, not an escalator.

## Why Interest Rate Policy Is Problematic

MMT economists are skeptical of using interest rates to control inflation:

- **Higher rates are income for bondholders.** When the central bank raises rates, it pays more interest to people who hold government bonds—typically wealthy investors. This is potentially inflationary, not deflationary.

- **It's regressive.** Rate increases hurt debtors (working and middle class) and help creditors (wealthy). It redistributes upward.

- **The transmission mechanism is unreliable.** The chain from "higher rates → less borrowing → less spending → less inflation" has many weak links.

- **It works through unemployment.** To the extent rate increases reduce inflation, they do so by causing recession and job losses—a cruel and inefficient tool.

MMT recommends keeping rates low and stable (or even at zero) and using fiscal policy—spending and taxation—as the primary stabilization tool.

## Strengths of This View

- **Explains Japan.** Japan has run large deficits for decades and accumulated enormous government debt. According to mainstream theory, this should have caused high inflation and rising interest rates. Instead, Japan has experienced persistent deflation or very low inflation. MMT predicted this.

- **Explains post-2008 experience.** After the financial crisis, governments ran large deficits and central banks created trillions in new money through quantitative easing. The predicted inflation didn't arrive for years—because the economy had massive unused capacity.

- **Explains the 2021-2023 inflation.** MMT economists argued from the start that the post-pandemic inflation was supply-driven (COVID disruptions, shipping, energy) rather than caused by "excessive" government spending. As supply recovered, they predicted inflation would ease—which it did.

- **Reframes the policy debate.** Instead of asking "how will we pay for healthcare/infrastructure/climate action?" MMT asks "do we have the workers, materials, and productive capacity to do this?" The constraint is real, not financial.

- **Full employment without inflation.** The Job Guarantee provides a mechanism—untested at scale but theoretically coherent—to achieve something mainstream economics says is impossible: genuine full employment with price stability.

## Limitations and Critiques

- **The Job Guarantee is untested.** No modern economy has implemented a full Job Guarantee. Design and administration are complex. Could government really employ millions of people productively?

- **Political economy risks.** Even if MMT is correct economically, "the government can't run out of money" might be heard as "deficits don't matter." Politicians might use the framework to justify wasteful spending.

- **Exchange rate vulnerability.** For countries that import essential goods, excessive spending can depreciate the currency, causing imported inflation. MMT applies most cleanly to the United States (which issues the world's reserve currency) and less clearly to smaller, more trade-dependent economies.

- **Inflation is hard to fine-tune.** Even with correct diagnosis, adjusting fiscal policy is slow (legislation takes time). By the time policy responds, conditions may have changed.

- **Real capacity is hard to measure.** When is the economy "at capacity"? There's no simple aggregate measure—capacity is sector-specific and changes over time.

## A Different Conversation

MMT doesn't just offer different answers—it asks different questions. Instead of "how do we balance the budget?" it asks "how do we balance the economy?" Instead of "can we afford full employment?" it asks "can we afford unemployment?"

The question isn't whether the government has enough money. The question is whether we have enough teachers, nurses, construction workers, engineers, and raw materials to accomplish our goals. If we do, money is never the constraint. If we don't, no amount of money can create them.
