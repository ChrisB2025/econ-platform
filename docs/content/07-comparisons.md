# Structured Comparisons: Schools of Thought on Inflation

## How to Use This Document

This document provides structured comparisons between schools of thought on key inflation questions. Each comparison is designed to be fair to all sides, presenting each view in its strongest form before noting critiques.

## Comparison 1: What Causes Inflation?

### The Question
What is the fundamental cause of sustained increases in the general price level?

### School Positions

| School | Primary Cause |
|--------|---------------|
| **Neoclassical** | Demand exceeding supply; expectations becoming unanchored |
| **Monetarist** | Money supply growing faster than output |
| **Austrian** | Credit expansion distorting interest rates and price signals |
| **Post-Keynesian** | Cost pressures and distributional conflict |
| **MMT** | Spending exceeding the economy's real productive capacity |
| **Ecological** | Biophysical resource constraints and depletion |

### Points of Agreement

Despite their differences, several schools agree that:
- Hyperinflation always involves some form of monetary dysfunction
- Supply shocks (oil, commodities) can cause inflation independent of demand
- Expectations play some role in how inflation unfolds

### Key Divergence: Money Supply vs. Real Factors

**Monetarists and Austrians** see money/credit creation as the fundamental cause. Without monetary expansion, sustained inflation cannot occur.

**Post-Keynesians and MMT** reverse the causality: money is created in response to economic activity (lending, spending). The money supply adjusts to accommodate inflation; it doesn't cause it.

**Neoclassical** economics sits in between: money matters in the long run, but real factors (shocks, expectations, output gaps) drive short-run dynamics.

**Ecological economists** point to factors outside this debate entirely: physical resource constraints that no monetary framework addresses.

### Mutual Critiques

- **Monetarist critique of Post-Keynesian**: "You can't have sustained inflation without monetary accommodation. Follow the money."
- **Post-Keynesian critique of Monetarist**: "Velocity is unstable, money is endogenous, and the 2008-2020 experience disproves the quantity theory."
- **Austrian critique of both**: "You're both looking at aggregates. The real damage is in relative price distortion and capital misallocation."
- **Ecological critique of all**: "You're all ignoring the elephant in the room: physical resources."

## Comparison 2: How Should Inflation Be Controlled?

### The Question
What policy tools are appropriate for controlling inflation?

### School Positions

| School | Primary Tool |
|--------|--------------|
| **Neoclassical** | Independent central bank adjusting interest rates |
| **Monetarist** | Rules-based money supply targeting |
| **Austrian** | End credit expansion; let markets adjust |
| **Post-Keynesian** | Income policies, wage coordination, industrial policy |
| **MMT** | Fiscal policy and taxation; Job Guarantee as wage anchor |
| **Ecological** | Accept some inflation as real scarcity; transition to steady-state |

### Points of Agreement

- Central bank independence has some value (though post-Keynesians and MMT are more skeptical)
- Supply-side investments can reduce inflationary pressure
- Hyperinflation requires addressing underlying dysfunction (fiscal, political, productive)

### Key Divergence: Monetary vs. Fiscal Tools

**Neoclassical, Monetarist, and Austrian** schools emphasize monetary/credit policy as the primary lever (though Austrians want less of it, not different targets).

**Post-Keynesian and MMT** argue that fiscal policy and income policies are more effective and less harmful than interest rate manipulation.

**Ecological** economists suggest the question may be misconceived: some inflation reflects real scarcity that policy cannot eliminate.

### The Interest Rate Debate

**Neoclassical/Mainstream view**: Interest rate adjustments are the primary tool. Higher rates reduce demand and cool inflation.

**Post-Keynesian critique**: Interest rates work (if at all) by causing unemployment. They redistribute from debtors to creditors. And they're a cost of production, so raising rates can be directly inflationary.

**MMT critique**: Interest payments are income for bondholders—raising rates may be inflationary, not deflationary. Keep rates low; use fiscal policy instead.

**Austrian critique**: The central bank shouldn't be setting interest rates at all. Let the market discover the natural rate.

## Comparison 3: The Phillips Curve and NAIRU

### The Question
Is there a trade-off between inflation and unemployment? Is there a "natural" rate of unemployment below which inflation accelerates?

### School Positions

| School | Position on Phillips Curve/NAIRU |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| **Neoclassical** | Short-run trade-off exists; long-run curve is vertical at NAIRU |
| **Monetarist** | Similar—natural rate determined by real factors, not monetary policy |
| **Austrian** | Reject aggregates; focus on capital structure, not unemployment rate |
| **Post-Keynesian** | NAIRU is a myth; full employment is compatible with price stability |
| **MMT** | NAIRU is a policy choice, not a natural constraint; Job Guarantee solves this |
| **Ecological** | Secondary concern compared to biophysical constraints |

### The Mainstream Position

Neoclassical economics holds that there is a NAIRU—a level of unemployment below which inflation will accelerate. Trying to push unemployment below this rate through demand stimulus will succeed only temporarily before inflation takes off.

This concept guides central bank policy: don't let labor markets get "too tight."

### The Heterodox Challenge

**Post-Keynesian response**: The NAIRU cannot be observed directly. Estimates have shifted dramatically over time. It functions as ideology—justifying unemployment as "natural" rather than as a policy choice.

**MMT response**: The NAIRU is self-fulfilling. Policymakers who believe in it create it by refusing to pursue full employment. The Job Guarantee offers a way to have full employment with price stability.

**Empirical puzzle**: The US achieved very low unemployment in 2018-2019 and again in 2022-2023 without the accelerating inflation NAIRU theory predicted. The Phillips curve has "flattened."

## Comparison 4: The Money Supply Question

### The Question
Is the money supply controlled by the central bank (exogenous) or created by economic activity itself (endogenous)?

### School Positions

| School | Money Exogenous or Endogenous? |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Neoclassical** | Mixed—central bank sets rates, which influence credit creation |
| **Monetarist** | Primarily exogenous—central bank controls money supply |
| **Austrian** | Focus on credit, which is expanded through banking system |
| **Post-Keynesian** | Endogenous—loans create deposits; money supply responds to demand |
| **MMT** | Endogenous—created by government spending and bank lending |
| **Ecological** | Money questions are secondary to real resource flows |

### Why This Matters

If money is **exogenous** (controlled by the central bank), then the central bank can control inflation by controlling money growth. This supports monetarist and mainstream policy frameworks.

If money is **endogenous** (created by lending and spending), then the central bank doesn't control the money supply—it sets the price of credit. The quantity theory breaks down. Post-Keynesian and MMT views are supported.

### The Evidence

- Central banks abandoned money supply targeting in the 1980s because they couldn't reliably control it
- Bank of England research (2014) confirmed that "loans create deposits"—money creation is endogenous
- The 2008-2020 experience: massive central bank money creation (QE) did not produce the inflation monetarism predicted

## Comparison 5: The 2021-2023 Inflation Episode

### The Question
What caused the inflation surge following the COVID-19 pandemic?

### School Interpretations

| School | Primary Explanation |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Neoclassical** | Demand recovered faster than supply; some fiscal stimulus excess |
| **Monetarist** | Massive money creation during COVID (stimulus, QE) |
| **Austrian** | Years of easy credit created fragility; pandemic revealed malinvestments |
| **Post-Keynesian** | Supply disruptions + profit-push as firms raised markups |
| **MMT** | Supply-side shock (COVID, shipping, energy) hitting real capacity |
| **Ecological** | Energy constraints (especially post-Ukraine invasion) exposed real limits |

### Points of Agreement

All schools acknowledge that supply disruptions played a significant role—container shipping costs, semiconductor shortages, labor market disruptions from COVID.

### Key Disagreements

**Was fiscal stimulus excessive?**
- Mainstream/Monetarist: Yes, the American Rescue Plan added fuel to the fire
- MMT/Post-Keynesian: No, inflation was supply-driven; stimulus prevented worse recession

**Was corporate profit-taking a driver?**
- Post-Keynesian: Yes, profit margins expanded substantially—profit-push inflation
- Mainstream: Profits rose but were response to demand, not independent cause

**Did the Fed respond appropriately?**
- Mainstream: Yes, rate increases were necessary to anchor expectations
- Post-Keynesian/MMT: Rate hikes were unnecessary and harmful; supply was already normalizing

## Comparison 6: Hyperinflation

### The Question
What causes extreme inflation (hyperinflation)?

### School Positions

All schools agree hyperinflation involves severe dysfunction—they differ on what's fundamental.

| School | Primary Cause of Hyperinflation |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Neoclassical** | Fiscal dominance; money financing of unsustainable deficits |
| **Monetarist** | Extreme money supply growth from government printing |
| **Austrian** | Flight from currency as monetary debasement becomes obvious |
| **Post-Keynesian** | Collapse of productive capacity; foreign debt; political breakdown |
| **MMT** | Loss of real productive capacity, typically with foreign currency debt |
| **Ecological** | Collapse of resource base manifesting as monetary breakdown |

### Common Ground

Historical hyperinflations (Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, Venezuela) all involve:
- Severe political/institutional dysfunction
- Collapse of productive capacity
- Often: foreign-currency debt obligations
- Rapid money creation (though cause vs. effect is debated)

### The MMT/Post-Keynesian Emphasis

These schools emphasize that hyperinflations typically occur after severe supply destruction (war, revolution, economic collapse) and/or when countries owe debt in foreign currencies they cannot print. Zimbabwe and Venezuela didn't just print money—they lost the ability to produce.

This matters because it challenges the simple narrative "printing money causes hyperinflation." The causality may run the other way: breakdown causes both money printing and hyperinflation.

## Comparison 7: The Role of Central Banks

### The Question
What should central banks do? Are they part of the solution or part of the problem?

### School Positions

| School | View of Central Banking |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Neoclassical** | Essential for price stability; independence crucial |
| **Monetarist** | Useful if following rules; dangerous with discretion |
| **Austrian** | The problem, not the solution; abolish if possible |
| **Post-Keynesian** | Overrated; may serve class interests; need democratic accountability |
| **MMT** | Should coordinate with fiscal policy; independence is mostly theater |
| **Ecological** | Secondary concern compared to real physical constraints |

### The Spectrum

On one end, **Austrians** see central banks as the source of inflation through credit expansion. Abolition or radical reform is the ideal.

In the middle, **Monetarists** want central banks constrained by rules, while **Neoclassical** economists trust them with discretion as long as they're independent.

On the other end, **Post-Keynesian** and **MMT** economists see central banks as less powerful than claimed and potentially harmful when they use interest rates to fight inflation by causing unemployment.

## Using These Comparisons

These comparisons can support several platform features:

1. **Side-by-side comparison tool**: User selects two schools, sees their positions on chosen dimensions
2. **Question-based exploration**: User asks "what causes inflation?" and sees all schools' answers
3. **Debate format**: Present School A's claim, School B's critique, School A's response
4. **Evidence matrix**: How does each school explain specific historical episodes?

The goal is always to present each school fairly, let them speak for themselves, and let users draw their own conclusions.
