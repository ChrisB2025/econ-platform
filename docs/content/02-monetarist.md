# The Monetarist View: Inflation Is Always a Monetary Phenomenon

## The Core Idea

Monetarism, most closely associated with Milton Friedman and the Chicago School, offers a direct and forceful claim: inflation is caused by the money supply growing faster than the economy's output. Nothing more, nothing less. "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon," Friedman famously declared.

This view shifts attention away from wages, oil prices, and government spending—the factors that often dominate public debate—and focuses squarely on money. If the government and central bank control the money supply properly, inflation will be low. If they allow money to grow too fast, inflation is inevitable. The cure for inflation is therefore simple in principle: slow down money growth.

## How Inflation Happens

The monetarist mechanism is captured in a simple equation: **MV = PQ**

- **M** = the money supply
- **V** = the velocity of money (how many times money changes hands in a year)
- **P** = the price level
- **Q** = real output (the quantity of goods and services produced)

If velocity (V) and output (Q) are relatively stable—or at least predictable—then changes in the money supply (M) will directly affect prices (P). Double the money supply, and prices will eventually double.

Why does more money mean higher prices? Friedman's explanation is intuitive: when people have more money than they want to hold, they spend it. This extra spending bids up prices. The process continues until prices have risen enough to bring the real value of money holdings back to desired levels.

In the short run, monetary expansion can temporarily boost output and reduce unemployment—people are fooled into thinking the extra money is real wealth. But this effect fades as people adjust their expectations. In the long run, the only lasting effect of printing money is higher prices.

## The Natural Rate and Expectations

Monetarists argue that the economy has a "natural rate" of unemployment determined by real factors—the skills of workers, the efficiency of job matching, regulations, and so on. Monetary policy cannot permanently push unemployment below this natural rate.

If the central bank tries to use monetary expansion to reduce unemployment, the initial effect might be positive—more money, more spending, more hiring. But workers and firms eventually catch on. They start expecting inflation and adjust their behavior accordingly. Wages rise to compensate for expected price increases. The stimulative effect of the extra money disappears, leaving only higher inflation.

This is why monetarists oppose "fine-tuning" the economy. Attempts to boost employment through loose monetary policy lead not to permanently lower unemployment, but to accelerating inflation.

## Policy Prescriptions

Monetarists advocate a simple rule: **grow the money supply at a constant, predictable rate** matching the long-run growth rate of the economy (perhaps 3-5% per year). No discretion, no attempts to respond to every economic wiggle—just steady, predictable money growth.

**Why rules over discretion?**

- Monetary policy works with "long and variable lags"—by the time a policy change affects the economy, conditions may have changed
- Discretionary policy tends to be destabilizing—policymakers overreact and make things worse
- A credible rule anchors expectations and makes the policy more effective

**Central bank independence** is desirable because politicians have incentives to inflate (stimulating the economy before elections), while an independent central bank can focus on long-term price stability.

**Fiscal policy is secondary.** Monetarists argue that government spending and deficits don't directly cause inflation unless they lead to money creation. Fiscal stimulus that's financed by borrowing from the public (rather than printing money) will crowd out private spending, limiting its effectiveness.

## Strengths of This View

- **Explains hyperinflation**: Every case of hyperinflation—Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, Venezuela—involves explosive money supply growth. Governments printing money to cover deficits is the proximate cause.

- **International evidence**: Across countries and over long periods, there's a correlation between money growth and inflation. Countries that maintain slow, steady money growth tend to have lower inflation.

- **The Volcker episode**: When Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker tightened monetary policy sharply in 1979-1982, inflation fell dramatically—from double digits to around 4%. Monetarists cite this as proof that controlling money can control inflation.

- **Intellectual discipline**: The framework forces clarity about what's fundamental (money) versus what's symptomatic (wage demands, oil prices).

## Limitations and Critiques

Monetarism's influence has waned since its 1980s peak, largely due to practical problems:

- **Velocity isn't stable**: The quantity theory depends on velocity being predictable. But velocity has fluctuated wildly since the 1980s, breaking the tight link between money and prices. This is why central banks abandoned money supply targeting.

- **What is "money"?**: As finance has evolved, the boundaries of money have blurred. Should we target M1? M2? M3? Different measures give different signals, and none tracks inflation reliably.

- **2008-2020 puzzle**: After the financial crisis, central banks engaged in massive "quantitative easing"—creating trillions in new money. According to monetarism, this should have caused high inflation. It didn't. Inflation remained stubbornly low for years.

- **Causality questions**: Does money growth cause inflation, or does inflation cause money growth? If money is created in response to economic activity (endogenous money), the monetarist story may have the causality backwards.

- **The transmission mechanism is vague**: How exactly does more money translate into higher spending and prices? The mechanism is intuitive but lacks microeconomic precision.

## Key Figures

- **Milton Friedman (1912-2006)**: The intellectual leader of monetarism, Nobel laureate, and author of the famous dictum about inflation being "always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"
- **Anna Schwartz (1915-2012)**: Co-author with Friedman of *A Monetary History of the United States*, which provided the empirical backbone for monetarism
- **Karl Brunner and Allan Meltzer**: Developed the theoretical foundations more formally

## Historical Context

Monetarism rose to prominence in the 1970s as an alternative to Keynesian economics. The stagflation of that decade—high inflation combined with high unemployment—seemed to refute the Keynesian Phillips curve trade-off and support the monetarist view that inflation was a monetary problem requiring monetary solutions.

The Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s was monetarism's moment of triumph. But the difficulty of actually implementing money supply targeting—because velocity proved unstable—led central banks to shift toward interest rate targeting instead. Today, few economists call themselves strict monetarists, but monetarist insights (the long-run neutrality of money, the importance of expectations, skepticism of fine-tuning) have been absorbed into mainstream economics.
