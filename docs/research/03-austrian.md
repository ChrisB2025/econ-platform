# Austrian View on Inflation

## 1. Overview

The Austrian school offers a distinctive theory of inflation rooted in its broader analysis of money, credit, and the business cycle. For Austrians, inflation is not simply "rising prices" but rather an expansion of the money supply—particularly credit expansion through the banking system. Rising prices are a symptom, not the phenomenon itself.

This view emerges from Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT), developed by Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. When the banking system, enabled by central bank policy, expands credit beyond the level of genuine savings, it distorts interest rates and price signals throughout the economy. This leads to malinvestment—resources flow into projects that seem profitable only because of artificially cheap credit. The eventual correction brings recession and reveals the misallocated capital.

Austrians argue that focusing on aggregate price indices like the CPI misses the most important effects of monetary expansion: changes in relative prices, distortion of the capital structure, wealth redistribution toward early recipients of new money, and the boom-bust cycle. They are deeply skeptical of central banking itself, viewing it as the institutional source of inflationary credit expansion.

## 2. Core Claims

- Inflation properly understood is an increase in the money supply, not rising prices
- Rising prices are a consequence of inflation, not inflation itself
- Credit expansion through fractional reserve banking creates money "out of thin air"
- Central banks enable and encourage this credit expansion through low interest rates and lender-of-last-resort functions
- Artificially low interest rates distort the price signals that coordinate economic activity
- This leads to malinvestment—investment in projects that are not sustainable given actual consumer preferences and savings
- The boom-bust cycle is caused by credit expansion, not inherent market instability
- Aggregate measures like CPI obscure the real effects of monetary expansion
- New money enters the economy at specific points, benefiting early recipients at the expense of later ones (Cantillon effects)
- Government and the financial sector benefit systematically from their privileged access to new money
- The cure for inflation is to stop the expansion of money and credit, not to manipulate interest rates

## 3. Causal Mechanism

**The Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT):**

1. **Credit expansion begins:** The central bank lowers interest rates below the "natural rate" (the rate that would prevail based on genuine time preferences and savings)

2. **Banks create money through lending:** Fractional reserve banking allows banks to lend more than they have in deposits. New loans create new money (deposit entries) without a corresponding increase in real savings

3. **Interest rate signals are distorted:** Lower interest rates signal to entrepreneurs that more resources are available for long-term projects. But this signal is false—actual savings haven't increased

4. **Malinvestment occurs:** Businesses undertake investment projects (especially capital-intensive, long-term projects) that would not be profitable at the true interest rate

5. **The boom phase:** The economy appears healthy. Asset prices rise. Employment increases. But the structure of production is becoming increasingly misaligned with actual consumer preferences

6. **The inevitable correction:** Eventually, the credit expansion must slow (inflation becomes too obvious, central bank tightens, or banks become cautious). The artificial boom cannot be sustained

7. **The bust:** Interest rates rise to reflect reality. Malinvestments are revealed as unprofitable. Businesses fail. Unemployment rises. Asset prices collapse. This is not a failure of markets but the necessary correction of previous distortions

**The Cantillon Effect:**

Named after Richard Cantillon (18th-century economist), this describes how new money enters the economy:

1. New money is not distributed evenly—it enters at specific points (banks, government contractors, financial institutions)
2. Early recipients can spend the new money before prices adjust
3. As the money circulates, prices gradually rise
4. Later recipients (wage earners, those on fixed incomes) receive the money only after prices have already risen
5. The result is a redistribution of wealth from late recipients to early recipients

This means inflation is not just a general rise in prices but a systematic transfer of purchasing power—typically from ordinary workers to the financial sector and government.

## 4. Key Assumptions

- **Subjective theory of value:** Economic value is determined by individual preferences, not objective factors. This makes aggregate measures suspect

- **Time preference is real:** People genuinely prefer goods now to goods later. The interest rate reflects this preference

- **Capital is heterogeneous:** Capital goods are not interchangeable blobs but specific tools for specific purposes. Malinvestment means the wrong kinds of capital have been created

- **Knowledge is dispersed:** No central authority can know what the "right" interest rate is. Only market processes can discover it

- **The price system coordinates activity:** Prices, including the interest rate, carry information. Distorting prices distorts coordination

- **The market tends toward equilibrium:** Left alone, markets self-correct. Boom-bust cycles are caused by intervention, not inherent instability

- **Methodological individualism:** Only individuals act. Aggregates like "the economy" don't make decisions

- **Fractional reserve banking is inherently unstable:** The practice of lending out deposited funds creates money that doesn't represent real savings

## 5. Policy Prescriptions

**Stop the credit expansion:**
- The fundamental solution is to end the artificial expansion of money and credit
- Central banks should not manipulate interest rates
- Let the market determine the natural rate of interest

**Ideally, abolish central banking:**
- Many Austrians see the central bank itself as the problem
- Without a lender of last resort, banks would be more cautious
- Competition among currencies would discipline money creation

**Return to sound money:**
- Some Austrians advocate returning to a gold standard or other commodity money
- Hard money that cannot be arbitrarily expanded would prevent inflationary credit cycles
- Others advocate free banking—competing private currencies without a central monopoly

**Allow the recession to correct malinvestments:**
- Bailouts and stimulus only delay the necessary correction
- Recessions are the painful but necessary process of reallocating misallocated capital
- Propping up failing businesses prevents resources from moving to productive uses

**End fractional reserve banking (for some Austrians):**
- Require banks to hold 100% reserves against demand deposits
- This would eliminate the money multiplication process
- Only genuine savings could fund loans

**Eliminate government deficit spending:**
- Deficit spending, monetized by the central bank, is a primary source of inflationary expansion
- Government should be constrained to spend only what it collects in taxes

## 6. Supporting Evidence

**Historical examples of credit-fueled booms and busts:**
- The 1920s credit expansion preceding the Great Depression
- The 2000s housing bubble and 2008 financial crisis
- The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s
- Various sovereign debt crises following periods of cheap credit

**The 2008 financial crisis:**
- Austrians argue they predicted it based on ABCT
- Years of low interest rates (the "Greenspan put") encouraged excessive risk-taking and malinvestment in housing
- The boom was artificial; the bust was the correction

**Asset price inflation:**
- While CPI remained moderate in the 2010s, asset prices (stocks, bonds, real estate) soared
- Austrians argue this is where the inflation went—conventional measures missed it
- QE benefited asset holders (early recipients of new money) at the expense of workers

**Cantillon effects in practice:**
- Empirical studies of money injection points
- The financial sector's share of GDP and profits has grown as monetary policy became more active
- Wealth inequality has increased alongside monetary expansion

**Historical monetary regimes:**
- Gold standard periods showed greater long-run price stability
- Fiat money regimes consistently show inflation over time
- Countries that abandoned hard money saw their currencies depreciate

**Entrepreneurial narratives:**
- Business cycle patterns consistent with ABCT
- Long-term investment projects (construction, heavy industry) are most volatile
- These sectors lead both booms and busts, as the theory predicts

## 7. Acknowledged Weaknesses

**Difficulty of empirical testing:**
- ABCT is hard to test with aggregate data because it concerns relative prices and capital structure, not aggregates
- Critics argue it is unfalsifiable—any data can be interpreted to fit the theory

**The "natural rate" is unobservable:**
- If we can't measure the natural interest rate, how do we know when it's been distorted?
- Austrians respond that this is precisely the knowledge problem—only markets can discover it

**Deflation concerns:**
- Critics argue that hard money would be deflationary as the economy grows
- Austrians are split on whether mild deflation is benign or harmful

**Political economy:**
- Even if Austrian policy prescriptions are correct, they are politically difficult
- Abolishing central banks, returning to gold, or allowing recessions without intervention lacks democratic support

**The Great Depression:**
- Some argue that the severity of the Depression shows what happens when Austrian prescriptions (tight money, no bailouts) are followed
- Austrians counter that the Depression was caused by prior credit expansion and prolonged by government intervention

**Complexity of modern finance:**
- Financial innovation has complicated the relationship between base money and credit
- The simple story of fractional reserve expansion doesn't capture derivatives, shadow banking, etc.

**No theory of aggregate demand:**
- Austrians reject aggregate concepts, but recessions do seem to involve general declines in spending
- The theory focuses on capital structure, not the demand side

## 9. Common Critiques (from other schools)

**From Keynesians and Mainstream:**
- The natural rate of interest is a metaphysical concept, not empirically useful
- Markets don't self-correct quickly enough—prolonged unemployment is too costly
- Deflation can be deeply harmful (debt deflation, liquidity traps)
- The gold standard performed poorly historically (frequent banking crises, deflationary depressions)
- ABCT cannot explain why all industries contract during recessions, not just those that overinvested

**From Post-Keynesians:**
- Money is endogenous—it's created by bank lending, not controlled by central banks
- ABCT's version of endogenous money (credit expansion) misunderstands how modern banking works
- Interest rates are set administratively by central banks, not discovered by markets
- The "natural rate" is a fiction

**From Monetarists:**
- Austrians reject useful aggregates and quantitative methods
- The policy prescription (do nothing) is nihilistic and politically impossible
- Even if ABCT is correct, some monetary policy is needed to manage a complex economy

**From MMT:**
- Austrians fundamentally misunderstand sovereign currency
- Government spending is not funded by money creation—it is money creation
- The constraint on spending is real resources, not some gold-standard logic

**Empirical critiques:**
- The theory predicts that capital goods industries should lead the cycle, but this is not consistently observed
- Low interest rates don't always lead to the predicted malinvestment pattern
- Some credit expansions don't end in severe busts

**Logical critiques:**
- If entrepreneurs are rational, why do they systematically make the same mistake every cycle?
- Why can't they learn that low interest rates might be artificial?
