# Monetarist View on Inflation

## 1. Overview

Monetarism, most closely associated with Milton Friedman and the Chicago School, holds that inflation is fundamentally and exclusively a monetary phenomenon. The central thesis is direct: inflation results from the money supply growing faster than real economic output. Control the money supply, and you control inflation.

This view gained prominence in the 1970s as an alternative to the Keynesian consensus that had dominated postwar economics. Where Keynesians emphasized fiscal policy and demand management, monetarists argued that the money supply was the key variable. The apparent failure of Keynesian policies to contain 1970s stagflation gave monetarism its moment of greatest influence.

While pure monetarism is less fashionable today—partly because of the difficulty of targeting money supply in practice—its core insights have been absorbed into mainstream macroeconomics. The emphasis on inflation expectations, the importance of central bank credibility, and the long-run neutrality of money all have monetarist roots. Monetarism's intellectual legacy shapes how central bankers think, even if few now describe themselves as strict monetarists.

## 2. Core Claims

- "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"—Friedman's famous dictum
- The money supply is the primary determinant of the price level in the long run
- The quantity theory of money holds: MV = PQ (money × velocity = prices × output)
- Changes in money supply affect real output only temporarily; in the long run, only prices adjust
- Velocity of money is stable or at least predictable over time
- There is a "natural rate" of unemployment determined by real factors, not monetary policy
- Attempts to push unemployment below the natural rate through monetary expansion will only cause inflation
- Central banks should follow rules rather than discretion—ideally, targeting a constant rate of money supply growth
- Inflation is harmful because it distorts price signals and redistributes wealth arbitrarily
- Governments cause inflation when they finance spending by money creation rather than taxation or borrowing

## 3. Causal Mechanism

The monetarist causal story is encapsulated in the quantity equation: **MV = PQ**

- **M** = Money supply
- **V** = Velocity of money (how many times money changes hands)
- **P** = Price level
- **Q** = Real output (quantity of goods and services)

**The mechanism:**

1. The central bank increases the money supply (M)
2. With velocity (V) and output (Q) relatively stable in the short-to-medium run...
3. The price level (P) must rise to maintain the equation
4. This is inflation

**Why does more money lead to higher prices?**

Friedman's explanation: When people have more money than they want to hold, they spend it. This increased spending bids up prices. The process continues until prices have risen enough that the real value of money balances is restored to desired levels.

**The transmission mechanism:**

1. Central bank increases money supply through open market operations
2. Banks have excess reserves, expand lending
3. More money in the economy chases the same goods
4. Prices rise

**The natural rate and expectations:**

- In the short run, monetary expansion can temporarily boost output and employment
- But workers and firms eventually adjust their inflation expectations
- Once expectations adjust, the economy returns to its "natural rate" of unemployment
- The only lasting effect is higher prices

**The expectations-augmented Phillips curve:**

Friedman argued that the original Phillips curve trade-off (lower unemployment = higher inflation) only exists when inflation is unanticipated. Once people expect inflation:
- Workers demand higher wages upfront
- Firms raise prices preemptively
- The short-run boost to employment disappears
- Attempting to exploit the trade-off leads to accelerating inflation

## 4. Key Assumptions

- **Velocity is stable:** The quantity theory works only if velocity is predictable. If V fluctuates wildly, the link between M and P breaks down

- **Money supply is controllable:** The central bank can effectively control the quantity of money in the economy

- **Markets are efficient and clear:** Prices adjust to equilibrate supply and demand; monetary policy only affects the nominal scale

- **Real and monetary spheres are distinct in the long run:** Money is a "veil"—it affects only nominal variables, not the real structure of production

- **Rational or adaptive expectations:** People eventually figure out the inflation rate and adjust behavior accordingly

- **Government cannot systematically fool the public:** Any attempt to exploit the short-run Phillips curve will be anticipated and neutralized

- **There exists a well-defined natural rate of unemployment:** The economy has an equilibrium determined by real factors (preferences, technology, institutions)

## 5. Policy Prescriptions

**The k-percent rule:**
Friedman's preferred policy was simple: grow the money supply at a constant rate (say, 3-5% annually) matching long-run output growth. No discretion, no fine-tuning.

**Why rules over discretion:**
- Discretionary policy is destabilizing—policymakers react too late and too much
- The "long and variable lags" of monetary policy make fine-tuning impossible
- Rules provide predictability that allows private actors to plan

**Central bank independence:**
- The central bank should be insulated from political pressure
- Politicians have incentives to inflate (short-term stimulus) that are incompatible with price stability

**Against fiscal activism:**
- Fiscal policy is ineffective for stabilization (crowding out, Ricardian equivalence)
- Government should focus on stable rules, not demand management

**No attempt to fine-tune unemployment:**
- Trying to push unemployment below the natural rate only causes inflation
- Better to accept the natural rate and focus on supply-side reforms

**Credibility is everything:**
- If the public believes the central bank will maintain low money growth, expectations stay anchored
- Inflation becomes self-stabilizing when credibility is established

**In practice (1970s-80s attempts):**
- The Federal Reserve under Volcker adopted monetary targeting
- Focus on money supply growth rates
- Accept short-run pain (recession) to break inflationary expectations

## 6. Supporting Evidence

**The Great Inflation (1965-1982):**
- US money supply growth accelerated through the 1960s and 1970s
- Inflation followed with a lag
- Monetarists saw this as confirmation of the quantity theory

**International comparisons:**
- Countries with faster money supply growth tend to have higher inflation
- Cross-country regressions showed correlation between M and P across time and space

**Hyperinflation episodes:**
- Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, Venezuela—all characterized by explosive money creation
- The proximate cause is always monetary: government printing to finance deficits

**The Volcker disinflation:**
- Tight monetary policy (high interest rates, slow money growth) brought inflation down
- Though painful, it demonstrated that inflation can be controlled through monetary means

**Long-run neutrality:**
- Over decades and across countries, money growth correlates with inflation, not with real GDP growth
- Supports the claim that money affects only nominal variables in the long run

**Velocity during stable periods:**
- During the 1950s-60s and parts of the 1990s-2000s, velocity was relatively stable
- The quantity theory worked reasonably well during these periods

## 7. Acknowledged Weaknesses

**Velocity instability:**
- Velocity became highly unstable in the 1980s and has been unpredictable since
- Financial innovation (credit cards, electronic payments, new financial instruments) changed how money is used
- This instability is why central banks abandoned money supply targeting

**Difficulty defining and measuring money:**
- What counts as "money"? M1? M2? M3?
- As financial systems evolved, the boundaries of money became blurred
- Different measures give different signals

**The transmission mechanism is unclear:**
- How exactly does money supply translate into spending and prices?
- The "hot potato" story is intuitive but lacks microeconomic foundations

**Short-run effects can be prolonged:**
- The "long run" in which money is neutral may be very long
- By then, as Keynes said, "we are all dead"

**Causality questions:**
- Does M cause P, or does P cause M?
- If money supply is endogenous (created in response to economic activity), the monetarist story inverts

**Liquidity trap:**
- When interest rates are at zero, monetary expansion may be ineffective
- Japan's "lost decades" and post-2008 experience challenged monetarist confidence

**Doesn't explain relative price changes:**
- Why do some prices rise faster than others?
- Monetarism speaks only to the general price level

## 9. Common Critiques (from other schools)

**From Post-Keynesians:**
- Money is endogenous—banks create money by lending, they don't wait for central bank reserves
- The direction of causality is reversed: credit creation causes money supply changes, not vice versa
- Velocity is not stable because it depends on financial conditions and confidence
- The quantity theory is tautological (MV=PQ is an identity, not a causal theory)

**From MMT:**
- Monetarists misunderstand the nature of modern fiat money
- The central bank sets interest rates, not the money supply
- Money supply is demand-determined, not exogenously controlled
- Inflation is about real resource constraints, not money quantity

**From Austrians:**
- Monetarists focus too narrowly on the price level
- The problem with money creation is not just inflation but distortion of the structure of production
- Aggregates like "the money supply" and "the price level" obscure crucial relative price effects

**From Keynesians:**
- In a liquidity trap, money supply increases are ineffective (pushing on a string)
- The velocity assumption has proven empirically false
- Animal spirits, uncertainty, and effective demand matter more than money supply

**From Ecological Economists:**
- Real constraints (energy, resources) limit output regardless of monetary conditions
- The model ignores biophysical reality

**Empirical critiques:**
- The 2008-2020 period saw massive monetary expansion with little inflation—where was the monetarist mechanism?
- Money supply targeting was abandoned because it didn't work in practice
- The correlation between M and P has weakened in recent decades
