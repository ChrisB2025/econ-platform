# Topic Map: Inflation Module

## Purpose

This document defines the sub-questions that structure the inflation module. Each question represents a dimension along which schools of thought may agree, diverge, or talk past each other.

---

## Core Questions

### 1. What is inflation?

**Scope:** Definition, measurement, and conceptual boundaries

- How is inflation defined? (General price level vs. specific prices)
- How is inflation measured? (CPI, PCE, GDP deflator, core vs. headline)
- What counts as "true" inflation vs. relative price changes?
- What is the difference between inflation, deflation, and disinflation?
- What about asset price inflation—does it count?

**Contested terrain:** Whether inflation is fundamentally about money (purchasing power) or about prices (cost of living); whether asset prices should be included in inflation measures.

---

### 2. What causes inflation?

**Scope:** The central contested question—causal mechanisms

- Is inflation caused by too much money chasing too few goods?
- Is inflation caused by rising costs (wages, materials, energy)?
- Is inflation caused by demand exceeding productive capacity?
- Is inflation caused by distributional conflict (workers vs. firms vs. government)?
- Is inflation caused by credit expansion and monetary policy?
- Is inflation caused by supply shocks and resource constraints?
- Is inflation caused by expectations becoming self-fulfilling?

**Contested terrain:** This is the primary battleground. Schools fundamentally disagree on the causal chain, which drives their policy prescriptions.

---

### 3. What are inflation's effects?

**Scope:** Economic and distributional consequences

- Who gains and who loses from inflation?
- How does inflation affect savings, debt, and wealth distribution?
- How does inflation affect economic planning and investment decisions?
- What is the difference between anticipated and unanticipated inflation?
- Is moderate inflation harmful, neutral, or beneficial?
- What are the costs of hyperinflation vs. moderate inflation?

**Contested terrain:** Whether moderate inflation is a serious economic problem or a manageable feature of a healthy economy; whether the distributional effects are progressive or regressive.

---

### 4. How is inflation controlled?

**Scope:** Policy responses and institutional arrangements

- What is the role of central banks in controlling inflation?
- What is the role of fiscal policy in controlling inflation?
- What is the role of wage and price controls?
- What is the role of supply-side policies?
- Should inflation targeting be the primary goal of monetary policy?
- What are the trade-offs involved in controlling inflation?

**Contested terrain:** Whether monetary policy alone is sufficient; whether inflation targeting is appropriate; what costs are acceptable to achieve price stability.

---

### 5. What is the relationship between inflation and employment?

**Scope:** The Phillips curve debate

- Is there a stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment?
- What is the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment)?
- Did the Phillips curve relationship break down? Why?
- How do expectations affect the inflation-employment relationship?
- Is full employment compatible with price stability?

**Contested terrain:** Whether the NAIRU is a real constraint or a policy choice; whether there is any meaningful long-run trade-off.

---

### 6. What is the relationship between inflation and money supply?

**Scope:** The monetarist thesis and its critiques

- Does money supply growth cause inflation?
- Is the relationship between money and prices stable?
- What is the role of velocity of money?
- Is money supply exogenous (controlled by central bank) or endogenous (created by lending)?
- Does "printing money" necessarily cause inflation?

**Contested terrain:** Whether the quantity theory of money holds empirically; whether money is exogenous or endogenous.

---

### 7. What is the relationship between inflation and fiscal policy?

**Scope:** Government spending, deficits, and inflation

- Do government deficits cause inflation?
- Under what conditions does fiscal expansion lead to inflation?
- What is the role of taxation in controlling inflation?
- How does government debt relate to inflation?
- What is "fiscal dominance" and when does it occur?

**Contested terrain:** Whether deficits are inherently inflationary; the MMT view that spending is limited by real resources, not financing.

---

### 8. What is the relationship between inflation and interest rates?

**Scope:** Monetary transmission mechanisms

- How do interest rates affect inflation?
- What is the "natural rate" of interest?
- Do higher interest rates reliably reduce inflation?
- What are the costs of using interest rates to fight inflation?
- What is the "Fisher effect"?

**Contested terrain:** Whether interest rate adjustments are effective and appropriate; heterodox arguments that rate hikes can be counterproductive.

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes

These themes recur across multiple questions:

1. **The role of expectations** — How do expectations shape inflationary dynamics? Are they rational, adaptive, or socially constructed?

2. **The money creation process** — Is money exogenous (controlled from outside the economy) or endogenous (created within the economy through lending)?

3. **Real vs. nominal** — How should we distinguish real economic phenomena from nominal/monetary phenomena?

4. **Path dependence** — Does the current inflation rate depend on history? Is there hysteresis?

5. **Power and conflict** — Is inflation ultimately about the distribution of resources between competing social groups?

6. **Biophysical constraints** — Are there physical limits (energy, resources) that constrain what monetary and fiscal policy can achieve?

## How Schools Will Be Compared

For each question above, each school of thought provides answers that reflect their:

- **Core theoretical framework** (how they model the economy)
- **Key assumptions** (what they take as given)
- **Empirical claims** (what evidence they cite)
- **Policy implications** (what should be done)

The comparison framework document (07-comparison-framework.md) will define the specific dimensions used to structure side-by-side comparisons.

## Module Boundaries

### In scope for MVP:
- All seven core questions above
- Six schools of thought (neoclassical, monetarist, Austrian, post-Keynesian, MMT, ecological)
- Historical examples: 1970s stagflation, 2021-2023 inflation surge, hyperinflation cases
- Current policy debates: inflation targeting, interest rate policy, fiscal stimulus

### Out of scope for MVP:
- Detailed country-specific analysis
- Mathematical models and formal derivations
- Historical inflation prior to 20th century
- Crypto/digital currency implications
- Comprehensive treatment of exchange rates and international inflation transmission

## Next Steps

1. Complete research documents for each school of thought (01-06)
2. Draft comparison framework (07)
3. Compile source materials bibliography (08)
4. Review all documents against "steel-man before critique" principle
5. Proceed to Phase 2: Content Writing
