# Comparison Framework: Dimensions for Comparing Schools of Thought on Inflation

## Purpose

This document defines the dimensions along which different schools of economic thought can be systematically compared on the topic of inflation. These dimensions will structure the comparison tools and side-by-side analyses in the platform.

---

## Primary Comparison Dimensions

### 1. Definition of Inflation

**Question:** What exactly is inflation according to this school?

| School | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Neoclassical | Sustained increase in the general price level, measured by indices like CPI |
| Monetarist | Rise in general price level, though some emphasize inflation *is* money supply growth |
| Austrian | Properly: expansion of money supply. Rising prices are a consequence, not inflation itself |
| Post-Keynesian | Rise in the general price level, with emphasis on cost increases and distributional conflict as drivers |
| MMT | Rise in prices when spending exceeds productive capacity of the economy |
| Ecological | Rise in prices, but distinguishing true scarcity signals from monetary phenomena |

---

### 2. Primary Causal Mechanism

**Question:** What fundamentally causes inflation?

| School | Primary Cause |
|--------|---------------|
| Neoclassical | Aggregate demand exceeding aggregate supply; expectations; money growth in long run |
| Monetarist | Money supply growth exceeding output growth ("always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon") |
| Austrian | Credit expansion through fractional reserve banking, lowering interest rates below natural rate |
| Post-Keynesian | Cost-push pressures and distributional conflict (wages vs. profits vs. rents) |
| MMT | Spending (public or private) exceeding the economy's real productive capacity |
| Ecological | Biophysical resource constraints; energy depletion; ecosystem degradation |

---

### 3. Role of Money Supply

**Question:** How important is the money supply in causing inflation?

| School | Role of Money Supply |
|--------|---------------------|
| Neoclassical | Central in long run (money is neutral); influences short-run dynamics |
| Monetarist | Determinative—money growth is the single most important variable |
| Austrian | Important but focus is on credit creation and interest rate distortion, not just aggregates |
| Post-Keynesian | Endogenous—money supply adjusts to accommodate economic activity, doesn't cause inflation |
| MMT | Endogenous—created by spending/lending; not independently controllable or causal |
| Ecological | Secondary—money can amplify or delay but not overcome real resource constraints |

---

### 4. Role of Expectations

**Question:** How do expectations affect inflation?

| School | Role of Expectations |
|--------|---------------------|
| Neoclassical | Central—expectations can become self-fulfilling; anchoring expectations is key to policy |
| Monetarist | Important for short-run dynamics; rational/adaptive expectations adjust to monetary policy |
| Austrian | Relevant but secondary to real credit distortions; expectations follow real signals |
| Post-Keynesian | Relevant but shaped by institutions, norms, power—not "rational" in mainstream sense |
| MMT | Matter but secondary to real capacity; expectations can't create resources |
| Ecological | Largely irrelevant—physical constraints don't respond to expectations |

---

### 5. Role of Labor Markets

**Question:** How do wages and labor market conditions affect inflation?

| School | Role of Labor Markets |
|--------|----------------------|
| Neoclassical | Central via Phillips curve; tight labor markets cause wage-price spirals; NAIRU is key constraint |
| Monetarist | Short-run Phillips curve exists but no long-run trade-off; labor markets matter temporarily |
| Austrian | Wages are one of many distorted prices during credit expansion; not the primary focus |
| Post-Keynesian | Central—wage bargaining and labor power are key to distributional conflict driving inflation |
| MMT | Important but Job Guarantee can achieve full employment without inflation via wage anchor |
| Ecological | Secondary—biophysical constraints matter more than labor market dynamics |

---

### 6. Role of Fiscal Policy

**Question:** Can/does government spending cause inflation?

| School | Role of Fiscal Policy |
|--------|----------------------|
| Neoclassical | Can contribute if deficits are monetized; fiscal dominance is a risk |
| Monetarist | Inflationary only if deficits lead to money creation; fiscal policy alone less important |
| Austrian | Government spending distorts price signals; deficit monetization is inflationary |
| Post-Keynesian | Can be inflationary if pushes past capacity; but often appropriate for full employment |
| MMT | Deficits not inherently inflationary; inflation occurs only when spending exceeds capacity |
| Ecological | Fiscal policy can't overcome biophysical limits; spending can't create absent resources |

---

### 7. Primary Policy Prescription

**Question:** How should inflation be controlled?

| School | Primary Prescription |
|--------|---------------------|
| Neoclassical | Independent central bank, inflation targeting, interest rate adjustments |
| Monetarist | Rules-based monetary policy; k-percent money growth rule |
| Austrian | End credit expansion; ideally abolish central banking; return to sound money |
| Post-Keynesian | Income policies, wage coordination, industrial policy; interest rates are blunt tool |
| MMT | Fiscal policy and taxation; Job Guarantee as wage anchor; low stable interest rates |
| Ecological | Transition to steady-state economy; accept some inflation as real scarcity signal |

---

### 8. Key Assumptions About Institutions

**Question:** What institutional arrangements does the theory assume?

| School | Key Institutional Assumptions |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Neoclassical | Central bank independence; credible commitment to targets; functioning markets |
| Monetarist | Central bank can control money supply; stable demand for money |
| Austrian | Fractional reserve banking exists; central bank enables credit expansion |
| Post-Keynesian | Markup pricing firms; organized labor; endogenous money creation by banks |
| MMT | Sovereign currency issuer; floating exchange rate; no foreign-currency debt |
| Ecological | Economy embedded in biosphere; resource extraction and environmental systems |

---

### 9. Key Assumptions About Human Behavior

**Question:** How do economic agents behave according to this theory?

| School | Behavioral Assumptions |
|--------|----------------------|
| Neoclassical | Rational optimization; forward-looking expectations; respond to incentives |
| Monetarist | Rational over time; learn from experience; can be temporarily fooled |
| Austrian | Subjective value; respond to price signals; entrepreneurs make mistakes when signals distorted |
| Post-Keynesian | Bounded rationality; decisions under uncertainty; class interests shape behavior |
| MMT | Respond to fiscal conditions; accept currency due to tax obligations |
| Ecological | Humans are part of natural systems; face biophysical constraints on choices |

---

### 10. Empirical Track Record

**Question:** How well has this theory explained/predicted real inflation episodes?

| School | Claimed Successes | Claimed Failures |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Neoclassical | Great Moderation; successful inflation targeting | 2008-2020 "missing inflation"; 2021-23 initially surprised |
| Monetarist | 1970s-80s inflation/disinflation | Velocity instability; 2008-2020 massive monetary expansion without inflation |
| Austrian | 2008 financial crisis predicted; asset bubbles | Hard to test quantitatively; timing uncertain |
| Post-Keynesian | Stagflation (supply + conflict); profit-driven 2021-23 inflation | Less precise predictions |
| MMT | Japan's deficits without inflation; 2021-23 supply-driven | Limited policy track record; untested Job Guarantee |
| Ecological | Oil shocks; commodity super-cycles | Timing of limits uncertain; growth continued longer than predicted |

## Secondary Comparison Dimensions

### 11. Position on the NAIRU

| School | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Neoclassical | Real constraint; estimates guide policy |
| Monetarist | Real but called "natural rate"; not stable policy target |
| Austrian | Reject aggregate concept; focus on capital structure |
| Post-Keynesian | Myth; policy choice not natural constraint |
| MMT | Reject; full employment achievable without inflation via Job Guarantee |
| Ecological | Not primary concern; biophysical limits more binding |

---

### 12. Position on Central Bank Independence

| School | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Neoclassical | Essential for credibility and effectiveness |
| Monetarist | Desirable; rules better than discretion but independence helps |
| Austrian | Central banks are the problem; abolish if possible |
| Post-Keynesian | Skeptical; may serve class interests; need democratic accountability |
| MMT | Coordinate with fiscal; independence is largely fiction anyway |
| Ecological | Secondary concern relative to biophysical constraints |

---

### 13. Position on Hyperinflation

**Question:** What causes hyperinflation?

| School | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Neoclassical | Extreme fiscal dominance; money financing of deficits; loss of credibility |
| Monetarist | Extreme money supply growth; government printing to finance deficits |
| Austrian | Extreme credit expansion; flight from currency |
| Post-Keynesian | Collapse of productive capacity; distributional collapse; often foreign-currency debt |
| MMT | Loss of productive capacity; typically combined with foreign-currency obligations |
| Ecological | Collapse of resource base; biophysical crisis manifesting as monetary collapse |

---

### 14. Theory of Value

**Question:** What determines economic value?

| School | Theory of Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Neoclassical | Marginal utility; supply and demand equilibrium |
| Monetarist | Same as neoclassical; utility maximization |
| Austrian | Subjective value; individual preferences are foundational |
| Post-Keynesian | Cost-plus markup; power relations; not pure marginalism |
| MMT | Similar to post-Keynesian; production costs plus markup |
| Ecological | Biophysical basis; energy and material throughput fundamental |

---

### 15. Internal Diversity

**Question:** How unified is this school?

| School | Internal Diversity |
|--------|-------------------|
| Neoclassical | Moderate—New Keynesian synthesis dominant but debates on details |
| Monetarist | Fairly unified historically; now largely absorbed into mainstream |
| Austrian | Significant—ranges from free banking advocates to 100% reserve advocates |
| Post-Keynesian | Substantial—various strands (Kaleckian, Minskyan, etc.) |
| MMT | Relatively unified core; debates on details like Job Guarantee design |
| Ecological | Substantial—de-growth advocates vs. green growth; steady-state vs. sustainability |

## How to Use This Framework

### For Side-by-Side Comparisons

1. Select two or more schools
2. Choose relevant dimensions
3. Present positions clearly with direct quotes where available
4. Identify points of agreement and disagreement
5. Note where schools "talk past each other" (different questions, different frameworks)

### For Topic-Specific Deep Dives

1. Take a specific question (e.g., "What causes hyperinflation?")
2. Survey all schools on that question
3. Present strongest version of each position
4. Identify the empirical evidence each cites
5. Note critiques each makes of others

### For Critical Analysis

1. Identify key assumptions that differentiate schools
2. Examine empirical evidence for/against each position
3. Note where evidence is contested vs. accepted
4. Highlight what each school acknowledges it cannot explain

## Notes for Content Writing

- Always present each school's position in its strongest form first
- Use quotes from key figures to ensure accuracy
- Identify where schools agree (often more than appears at first)
- Note where disagreement is empirical vs. theoretical vs. normative
- Avoid false balance—if evidence clearly favors one view, acknowledge it
- Distinguish between what a school *claims* and what *evidence supports*
