# Post-Keynesian View on Inflation

## 1. Overview

Post-Keynesian economics offers a fundamentally different account of inflation than the mainstream quantity-theory or demand-pull frameworks. For post-Keynesians, inflation is primarily a cost-push phenomenon driven by conflicts over income distribution—between workers seeking higher wages, firms seeking higher profits, and governments extracting taxes. The money supply is seen not as the cause of inflation but as something that adjusts endogenously to accommodate inflationary pressures.

This school of thought traces its intellectual lineage to Keynes himself (interpreted differently than by the mainstream "New Keynesian" synthesis), as well as to Michal Kalecki, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, and Hyman Minsky. Post-Keynesians emphasize fundamental uncertainty, the importance of effective demand, the role of institutions, and the reality of class conflict in capitalist economies.

The post-Keynesian critique of mainstream inflation theory is radical: they reject the NAIRU as a useful concept, deny that monetary policy controls the money supply, and argue that inflation is fundamentally about power—who has the ability to raise their prices or wages, and who must accept the increases imposed by others. This view has significant implications for policy: controlling inflation is not primarily about interest rates but about managing distributional conflict and maintaining productive capacity.

## 2. Core Claims

- Inflation is primarily cost-push, not demand-pull—it originates in rising costs of production, not excess demand
- The fundamental driver is conflict over income distribution: workers vs. firms vs. government vs. rentiers
- Money is endogenous—banks create money by lending, and the money supply adjusts to the needs of the economy
- Central banks cannot control the money supply; they set the interest rate (the price of credit)
- The NAIRU is not a real constraint but a policy choice—there is no stable, natural rate of unemployment
- Inflation and unemployment can coexist (stagflation) because they have different causes
- Expectations matter but are not "rational" in the mainstream sense—they are shaped by institutions, norms, and power relations
- The Phillips curve relationship is contingent on historical and institutional circumstances, not a stable law
- Markup pricing by firms is the mechanism through which cost increases become inflation
- Effective demand determines output and employment; supply does not automatically create its own demand

## 3. Causal Mechanism

**Cost-push and conflict inflation:**

Post-Keynesians identify several mechanisms through which inflation arises:

**1. Wage-price spiral (conflict theory):**
- Workers demand higher wages to maintain living standards
- Firms, facing higher wage costs, raise prices to maintain profit margins (markup pricing)
- Higher prices erode workers' real wages
- Workers demand further wage increases
- The spiral continues unless some group accepts a reduction in their real income share

**2. Imported inflation:**
- Rising import prices (oil, commodities, intermediate goods) raise production costs
- Firms pass these costs on through markup pricing
- Particularly important for countries that import energy or essential materials

**3. Profit-push inflation:**
- Firms with market power can raise prices beyond cost increases
- Increased profit margins can drive inflation independently of wages
- Particularly relevant in concentrated industries

**4. Commodity price shocks:**
- Resource constraints, speculation, or geopolitical events raise input costs
- These are supply-side shocks, not demand-side

**5. Exchange rate depreciation:**
- A falling currency makes imports more expensive
- Import prices feed into production costs

**The endogenous money mechanism:**

1. Firms need credit to pay for production before they receive revenue from sales
2. They approach banks for loans
3. Banks create money by crediting borrowers' accounts—they don't lend out pre-existing deposits
4. The money supply expands to meet the needs of production and trade
5. The central bank accommodates this by supplying reserves at its target interest rate
6. Money supply follows from economic activity, it doesn't cause it

**Why monetary policy doesn't control inflation directly:**

- The central bank sets the interest rate, not the money supply
- Higher interest rates are a cost of production (for firms carrying debt) and can actually be inflationary
- Rate increases redistribute income to creditors and may worsen distributional conflict
- Rate increases work (if they do) by causing recession—a crude and costly tool

## 4. Key Assumptions

- **Fundamental uncertainty:** The future is unknowable, not just unknown. Probability distributions don't capture real economic uncertainty

- **Money is not neutral:** Monetary variables affect real outcomes, even in the long run. Money is not a "veil"

- **Time is historical, not logical:** The economy is path-dependent. Past events shape present possibilities

- **Markets don't automatically clear:** Prices don't adjust instantly to balance supply and demand. Unemployment can persist indefinitely

- **Effective demand drives output:** Spending determines production, not the other way around. Say's Law does not hold

- **Firms set prices as markups over costs:** Prices are administered by firms with market power, not determined by auction markets

- **Class and power matter:** Economic outcomes reflect bargaining power between workers, firms, and other groups

- **Institutions shape outcomes:** Labor market institutions, wage-setting practices, and social norms determine the inflation-unemployment relationship

---

## 5. Policy Prescriptions

**Income policies and wage coordination:**
- Negotiate social compacts between labor, business, and government
- Coordinate wage growth with productivity growth to prevent wage-price spirals
- Strengthen institutions for collective bargaining (but with coordination across sectors)

**Prices and incomes policies:**
- In extreme cases, direct intervention in prices and wages may be necessary
- These have a mixed historical record but may be preferable to using unemployment as the anti-inflation tool

**Fiscal policy for full employment:**
- Use fiscal policy to maintain full employment
- Job guarantee programs provide a "buffer stock" of employment at stable wages
- Full employment is achievable and desirable; the NAIRU is not a binding constraint

**Industrial policy for supply capacity:**
- Invest in productive capacity to prevent bottlenecks that create inflationary pressure
- Strategic investment in energy, housing, and essential goods
- Address the real constraints that cause cost-push inflation

**Interest rate policy skepticism:**
- Interest rates are a blunt and often counterproductive tool
- Rate increases cause recessions, redistribute to creditors, and can be cost-inflationary
- If interest rates must be used, keep them low and stable; use other tools for inflation

**Address market power:**
- Antitrust policy to reduce profit-push inflation
- Regulation of sectors with monopoly pricing power
- Public options or price regulation in essential sectors

**Exchange rate management:**
- Manage the exchange rate to prevent imported inflation
- Capital controls may be necessary to maintain exchange rate stability

## 6. Supporting Evidence

**Stagflation of the 1970s:**
- Inflation and unemployment rose together, contradicting the Phillips curve trade-off
- Oil shocks (cost-push) combined with distributional conflict
- Post-Keynesian theory predicted this possibility; mainstream theory struggled to explain it

**Endogenous money evidence:**
- Empirical studies show that loans create deposits, not the other way around
- Bank of England research (2014) confirmed that money creation is endogenous
- Attempts to control monetary aggregates failed in the 1980s

**Markup pricing evidence:**
- Studies of actual firm pricing behavior show cost-plus markup, not marginal cost pricing
- Firms don't rapidly adjust prices to clear markets; they set prices administratively

**NAIRU instability:**
- Estimates of the NAIRU have changed dramatically over time
- The "natural rate" has no predictive power—it's estimated after the fact
- Countries with strong labor institutions (Scandinavia) achieved low inflation with low unemployment

**The 2021-2023 inflation:**
- Initial drivers were clearly supply-side: pandemic disruptions, shipping costs, energy prices
- Profits increased substantially—evidence of profit-push inflation
- The "hot labor market" explanation struggled to account for the pattern

**Sectoral price studies:**
- Detailed studies show inflation often concentrated in specific sectors (energy, housing, food)
- General demand pressure doesn't explain sector-specific patterns

**Historical examples of non-monetary inflation:**
- Medieval grain price fluctuations (supply shocks)
- Wartime inflation (supply constraints + distributional conflict)
- Oil shock inflations (external supply shock)

## 7. Acknowledged Weaknesses

**Income policies have a mixed record:**
- Wage and price controls often break down under pressure
- They can create distortions and black markets
- Require strong institutions and social consensus to work

**The theory is less precise than mainstream:**
- Without a NAIRU or other anchor, it's harder to make quantitative predictions
- "It depends on institutions and power" is accurate but less actionable

**Coordination problems:**
- Getting labor, business, and government to agree is politically difficult
- Works better in corporatist economies (Scandinavia, Germany) than in liberal market economies (US, UK)

**Demand-pull inflation can occur:**
- While emphasizing cost-push, post-Keynesians don't deny that excess demand can cause inflation
- The question is whether this is the primary mechanism—post-Keynesians say usually not

**Limited influence on policy:**
- Despite theoretical critiques, central banks continue to use interest rates as the primary tool
- Post-Keynesian policy prescriptions lack political support in most countries

**Heterogeneity within the school:**
- Post-Keynesians disagree among themselves on details
- The label covers a range of views, not a single unified theory

## 9. Common Critiques (from other schools)

**From Mainstream/Neoclassical:**
- The theory is too imprecise—"institutions matter" doesn't give actionable guidance
- Markets do eventually clear; the long run exists
- The NAIRU, while imperfectly measured, captures a real constraint
- Income policies have failed historically
- The theory lacks microfoundations

**From Monetarists:**
- Endogenous money is a red herring—the central bank still ultimately controls credit conditions
- The long-run quantity theory holds empirically across countries and time
- Income policies are interventionist distractions from sound money

**From MMT:**
- Post-Keynesians are too pessimistic about what full employment can achieve
- The tax-driven theory of money is underdeveloped in post-Keynesian work
- Job guarantee is underdeveloped compared to MMT's version

**From Austrians:**
- Post-Keynesians ignore the distorting effects of credit expansion on the capital structure
- Emphasis on demand management ignores the real causes of misalignment
- The theory endorses intervention that makes problems worse

**From Ecological Economists:**
- Post-Keynesians still assume growth is possible and desirable
- The biophysical constraints are underemphasized
- Full employment in a growth context may be ecologically unsustainable

**General critiques:**
- The theory explains everything and therefore nothing—too flexible
- If power and institutions determine everything, the theory has little predictive content
- Empirical testing is difficult because so many factors are left unspecified
