# Ecological Economics View on Inflation

## 1. Overview

Ecological economics brings a distinctive perspective to inflation by situating the economy within biophysical reality. Where other schools debate whether inflation is caused by money supply, demand pressure, or distributional conflict, ecological economists point to a dimension that others largely ignore: the physical world. The economy runs on energy, materials, and ecosystem services. When these become scarce, no amount of monetary manipulation or demand management can conjure them into existence.

This school of thought, developed by economists like Herman Daly, Robert Costanza, and others drawing on the work of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, treats the economy as a subsystem of the biosphere—subject to the laws of thermodynamics. Economic growth requires increasing throughput of energy and materials. When these hit constraints—whether from depletion, environmental degradation, or deliberate limits—the result can be inflation, as more money chases genuinely scarcer resources.

Ecological economists argue that conventional inflation theory, whether mainstream or heterodox, misses this fundamental point. Cost-push inflation from oil shocks isn't a temporary disturbance to be managed—it's a preview of a world where energy becomes permanently more expensive relative to labor. In this view, some inflation is not a sign of policy failure but of humanity bumping against planetary boundaries.

## 2. Core Claims

- The economy is a subsystem of the biosphere, subject to biophysical laws (thermodynamics, ecology)
- Economic activity requires continuous throughput of energy and materials, not just money and labor
- Finite resources impose real limits on economic growth that monetary policy cannot overcome
- Energy is the "master resource"—its cost sets a floor under all other production costs
- Resource depletion and environmental degradation are inflationary pressures that conventional economics ignores
- "Peak oil" (and peak fossil fuels more generally) implies structural, long-term energy price increases
- Climate change imposes costs (adaptation, damages, mitigation) that will manifest as inflation
- Throughput growth cannot continue indefinitely on a finite planet
- Much inflation attributed to other causes is actually resource-driven
- Monetary and fiscal policy cannot create energy or materials—they can only redistribute claims on them
- A sustainable economy may require accepting different price dynamics than a growth economy

## 3. Causal Mechanism

**Resource-driven inflation:**

1. **Depletion effects:** As easily accessible resources are exhausted, extraction moves to harder, more expensive deposits (deeper oil wells, lower-grade ores, farther fishing grounds)

2. **Energy costs:** Since energy is required for all economic activity, rising energy costs feed through to all prices (transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, services)

3. **Ecosystem degradation:** As natural systems degrade, the services they provided (pollination, water purification, climate regulation, fisheries) must be replaced by paid labor or technology—adding costs

4. **Climate change impacts:** Extreme weather destroys capital and crops. Adaptation requires investment. Supply chains are disrupted. Insurance costs rise. These are real costs that manifest as higher prices

5. **Environmental regulations:** As societies attempt to limit environmental damage, regulations impose costs on polluting activities. These costs are passed through to prices (and are appropriate—they reflect previously externalized costs)

**The Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI) mechanism:**

1. Early oil wells returned 100 barrels for every barrel of energy invested in extraction
2. As easy oil depleted, EROEI has fallen—now often below 20:1 for new sources, much lower for tar sands and some shale
3. Lower EROEI means more energy (and cost) goes into getting energy, leaving less for the rest of the economy
4. This is a physical constraint that no monetary policy can overcome

**The throughput constraint:**

1. Economic output requires material and energy throughput
2. GDP growth has historically required throughput growth
3. Throughput faces physical limits (finite resources, sink capacity for waste)
4. As throughput growth slows or reverses, traditional economic growth becomes harder
5. Attempting to grow output without throughput growth creates inflationary pressure

**Biophysical limits on productivity:**

- Technology can improve efficiency, but faces limits (thermodynamic, material)
- "Dematerialization" has limits—you cannot make a house out of nothing
- Agriculture faces declining returns (soil depletion, water scarcity, climate impacts)

---

## 4. Key Assumptions

- **The economy is embedded in nature:** Economic activity depends on natural systems and is constrained by them

- **Thermodynamic laws apply:** Energy cannot be created, only transformed. Entropy increases. These set absolute limits

- **Resources are finite:** Fossil fuels, minerals, fresh water, arable land—all have limits

- **Substitution has limits:** While technology can substitute some resources, fundamental constraints remain (you can't substitute energy with information indefinitely)

- **Ecosystem services have economic value:** Clean air, stable climate, pollination—these provide essential inputs that conventional economics treats as free

- **Growth cannot continue forever:** On a finite planet, physical growth must eventually stop. The question is whether we manage the transition or hit the wall

- **Prices should reflect true costs:** Current prices exclude environmental externalities; including them would show higher true costs

- **Scale matters:** The economy can become too large relative to the biosphere, even if internally efficient

## 5. Policy Prescriptions

**Transition to a steady-state economy:**
- Move away from growth as the primary goal
- Target stable (or declining) throughput rather than increasing GDP
- Measure success by well-being, not output

**Internalize environmental costs:**
- Carbon taxes or cap-and-trade for greenhouse gases
- Resource extraction taxes
- Pollution charges
- This will cause some measured inflation but reflects true costs

**Invest in renewable energy transition:**
- Accelerate shift from depleting fossil fuels to renewable sources
- Accept that the transition has costs (investment, stranded assets)
- The alternative (continued fossil dependence) is more inflationary long-term

**Resource efficiency and circular economy:**
- Reduce throughput through reuse, recycling, durability
- Design products for longevity and repairability
- Reduce waste to reduce resource pressure

**Managed de-growth in high-consumption societies:**
- Rich countries may need to reduce material consumption
- Redirect economic activity from goods to services, from quantity to quality
- "De-growth" doesn't mean misery—it means living better with less stuff

**Local resilience:**
- Reduce dependence on long, energy-intensive supply chains
- Build local food systems, local energy, local manufacturing
- This reduces vulnerability to energy shocks

**Monetary and fiscal realism:**
- Recognize that monetary policy cannot create physical resources
- Accept that some inflation reflects real scarcity, not policy failure
- Use fiscal policy to invest in the transition and protect vulnerable populations

## 6. Supporting Evidence

**Oil price shocks:**
- 1973, 1979, 2008, 2022—oil shocks caused inflation that monetary policy struggled to address
- These weren't temporary disturbances but signals of structural resource constraints
- The 2008 oil spike preceded the financial crisis; some argue it was a trigger

**Declining EROEI:**
- Data shows energy return on investment declining for oil and gas
- Tar sands and shale have EROEI of 5:1 or lower
- More energy going into energy extraction means less for everything else

**Commodity super-cycles:**
- 2000s commodity price increases across oil, metals, food
- Conventional economics saw this as a temporary cycle; ecological economists see structural shift

**Climate change costs:**
- Economic damages from climate already measurable (hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, flooding)
- Insurance costs rising; some areas becoming uninsurable
- Agricultural yields affected by changing weather patterns

**Historical resource constraints:**
- Easter Island, Mayan collapse, Norse Greenland—historical examples of civilizations hitting biophysical limits
- Not perfect analogies but demonstrate that limits are real

**Food price spikes:**
- 2007-08, 2010-11 food price crises
- Caused by combination of oil prices (affecting fertilizer and transport), biofuel competition, climate events
- Triggered political unrest in multiple countries

**The "Green Paradox" in transition:**
- Attempting to phase out fossil fuels can cause short-term price volatility
- Markets anticipate stranded assets; investment in fossil infrastructure declines
- Transition will be bumpy even if ultimately successful

## 7. Acknowledged Weaknesses

**Timing and magnitude uncertain:**
- "Peak oil" has been predicted many times; timing estimates have been wrong
- Technological innovation has extended resource availability
- Hard to know when limits bind

**Technological optimism has a track record:**
- Past predictions of resource exhaustion (Malthus, Club of Rome) didn't materialize as predicted
- Substitution and efficiency improvements have been substantial
- "This time is different" may or may not be true

**Difficult to integrate with conventional economics:**
- Mainstream models don't include biophysical variables
- Hard to quantify ecosystem services and resource constraints
- Policy frameworks assume growth is possible and desirable

**Political economy of de-growth:**
- No major economy has voluntarily pursued de-growth
- It challenges powerful interests (fossil fuel industry, growth-dependent finance)
- Difficult to achieve politically, especially internationally

**Distributional questions:**
- Who bears the cost of transition?
- De-growth in rich countries may be manageable; what about poor countries seeking development?
- Risk of "eco-austerity" that harms the vulnerable

**The theory is incomplete:**
- Ecological economics offers a critique but not a fully developed alternative macroeconomics
- Integration with monetary, fiscal, and labor market analysis is ongoing work

**Measurement challenges:**
- Biophysical metrics are harder to track than monetary ones
- Data on resource flows, ecosystem services, and environmental degradation is incomplete

## 9. Common Critiques (from other schools)

**From Mainstream/Neoclassical:**
- Markets adjust to scarcity through prices—this is the mechanism that prevents running out
- Technological innovation can overcome resource limits; history shows this
- "Limits to growth" predictions have consistently been wrong
- GDP growth can be "decoupled" from resource use
- The economy is not limited by physics in the way ecological economists claim

**From Monetarists:**
- Inflation is a monetary phenomenon; resource prices fluctuate but don't determine the overall price level
- Central bank policy can manage any inflationary pressures
- This is Malthusianism in new clothes

**From Post-Keynesians:**
- The theory is too deterministic—institutions and policy matter more than biophysics
- Resource constraints are real but mediated by social and economic systems
- De-growth is politically unrealistic; better to pursue green growth

**From MMT:**
- Resource constraints are real but not primarily about "affording" the transition
- Government can mobilize real resources for green investment
- The question is political will, not physical limits

**From Austrians:**
- Price signals already incorporate scarcity—no need for special ecological economics
- The solution to resource constraints is less government intervention, not more
- Markets discover and develop substitutes

**General critiques:**
- The school is more critique than positive theory
- Hard to operationalize—what policies follow specifically?
- Conflates many different issues (climate, resources, biodiversity) that may have different dynamics
- Too pessimistic—human ingenuity is underestimated
