# Neoclassical/Mainstream View on Inflation

## 1. Overview

The neoclassical or mainstream view treats inflation as fundamentally a monetary phenomenon that occurs when aggregate demand outpaces the economy's productive capacity. In this framework, the general price level is determined by the interaction of aggregate supply and aggregate demand, with the central bank playing the pivotal role in maintaining price stability through monetary policy.

Modern mainstream economics synthesizes several traditions: the quantity theory of money (the idea that money supply affects prices), the Phillips curve framework (the relationship between inflation and unemployment), and the role of expectations in shaping economic outcomes. This synthesis, sometimes called the "New Keynesian" consensus, accepts that money is neutral in the long run (only affecting prices, not real output) but can have real effects in the short run due to price and wage rigidities.

The mainstream view underpins most central bank policy frameworks worldwide, including inflation targeting regimes. It emphasizes the credibility of monetary institutions and the anchoring of inflation expectations as crucial to maintaining low and stable inflation.

## 2. Core Claims

- Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level, measured by indices like the CPI
- In the long run, inflation is determined by the growth rate of the money supply relative to the growth rate of real output
- In the short run, inflation can be influenced by demand shocks, supply shocks, and expectations
- There is a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment (the Phillips curve), but no long-run trade-off
- Inflation expectations are crucial: if people expect higher inflation, they will act in ways that make it happen
- Central banks can and should control inflation through monetary policy, primarily interest rates
- Price stability (low, predictable inflation) is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth
- The NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) represents the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation

## 3. Causal Mechanism

The mainstream model identifies several channels through which inflation can arise:

**Demand-pull inflation:** When aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply at current prices, firms respond by raising prices. This can occur due to:
- Excessive monetary expansion (too much money in the economy)
- Fiscal stimulus (government spending or tax cuts increasing demand)
- Asset price booms creating wealth effects
- External demand shocks (export booms)

**Cost-push inflation:** When the costs of production rise, firms pass these costs on to consumers. Sources include:
- Oil and commodity price shocks
- Wage increases exceeding productivity growth
- Exchange rate depreciation (making imports more expensive)
- Supply chain disruptions

**Expectations-driven inflation:** When economic agents expect inflation, they build it into their behavior:
- Workers demand higher wages to compensate for expected price increases
- Firms raise prices in anticipation of higher costs
- This can become self-fulfilling, creating an inflationary spiral

**The transmission mechanism of monetary policy:**
1. Central bank raises interest rates
2. Borrowing becomes more expensive, saving more attractive
3. Aggregate demand falls (less consumption, less investment)
4. Reduced demand pressure leads to lower inflation
5. Expectations adjust to the credible commitment to price stability

## 4. Key Assumptions

For the mainstream model to work as described, several assumptions must hold:

- **Markets clear, with frictions:** Prices and wages adjust to balance supply and demand, though adjustment may be slow due to menu costs, contracts, or information delays
- **Expectations matter and can be managed:** Economic agents form expectations about future inflation, and these expectations can be influenced by central bank communication and credibility
- **Money is neutral in the long run:** Changes in money supply affect only nominal variables (prices, nominal wages) in the long run, not real variables (output, employment)
- **The central bank can control inflation:** Through its monopoly on base money and its influence on interest rates, the central bank has the tools to control aggregate demand
- **There is a stable, identifiable NAIRU:** The economy has a natural rate of unemployment below which inflation accelerates
- **Supply and demand framework applies to the macro economy:** Aggregate supply and demand curves are meaningful constructs that describe the economy's behavior

## 5. Policy Prescriptions

**Primary prescription: Independent central bank with inflation target**
- Central bank should have a clear mandate for price stability
- Independence from political interference ensures credibility
- Explicit inflation target (typically 2%) anchors expectations
- Transparent communication about policy intentions

**Interest rate policy as the main tool:**
- Raise rates when inflation is above target or expected to rise
- Lower rates when inflation is below target or recession threatens
- Follow a rule-based approach (like the Taylor Rule) for consistency

**Fiscal policy should support monetary policy:**
- Avoid excessive deficits that force monetary accommodation
- Counter-cyclical fiscal policy can help in severe downturns
- But primary responsibility for price stability lies with the central bank

**Supply-side policies for long-term capacity:**
- Improve productivity through education, infrastructure, competition policy
- Reduce structural rigidities in labor and product markets
- These raise the economy's potential output, reducing inflationary pressure

**In the event of cost-push shocks:**
- Central bank should "look through" temporary supply shocks if expectations remain anchored
- But must respond if there are signs of second-round effects (wage-price spirals)

## 6. Supporting Evidence

**The Great Moderation (1985-2007):**
- Period of low and stable inflation in developed economies
- Attributed to improved central bank policy frameworks
- Inflation targeting countries showed particularly good outcomes

**Volcker disinflation (1979-1983):**
- Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply to break inflationary expectations
- Inflation fell from double digits to around 4%
- Cited as proof that determined monetary policy can control inflation (at the cost of recession)

**1970s stagflation:**
- Mainstream interpretation: Oil shocks combined with accommodative monetary policy and unanchored expectations
- Central banks failed to raise rates sufficiently, allowing inflation to become embedded

**Inflation targeting success stories:**
- New Zealand (first to adopt explicit inflation targeting in 1990)
- UK, Canada, Australia—all achieved low, stable inflation after adopting targeting frameworks
- Emerging markets (Chile, Brazil, Poland) also benefited from adopting inflation targeting

**Inflation expectations data:**
- Survey measures and market-based measures of inflation expectations
- These remained anchored during the 2008 financial crisis in countries with credible central banks
- Anchored expectations prevented deflation from taking hold

## 7. Acknowledged Weaknesses

Mainstream economists acknowledge several limitations and puzzles:

- **The Phillips curve has flattened:** The relationship between unemployment and inflation has become much weaker since the 1990s, making it harder to predict inflation from labor market data

- **Inflation was puzzlingly low after 2008:** Despite massive monetary expansion (QE), inflation remained below target for years—the "missing inflation" puzzle

- **Difficulty measuring the NAIRU:** The natural rate of unemployment cannot be directly observed and estimates have proven unreliable

- **Zero lower bound problem:** When interest rates hit zero, conventional monetary policy loses effectiveness; hence the need for unconventional tools like QE

- **Supply shocks are difficult to handle:** The framework offers no good answer for stagflation scenarios—fighting inflation causes unemployment, accommodating causes more inflation

- **Distributional effects often ignored:** The mainstream model focuses on aggregates and has less to say about who gains and loses from inflation and anti-inflation policy

- **Expectations are hard to manage in practice:** While the model emphasizes expectations, actually shifting them is difficult and depends on factors beyond central bank control

## 9. Common Critiques (from other schools)

**From Post-Keynesians:**
- The NAIRU is a myth that serves to justify unemployment
- Money is endogenous—central banks don't control money supply, they set the price of credit
- The Phillips curve relationship is based on flawed causality
- Inflation is primarily cost-push and conflict-driven, not demand-driven

**From MMT:**
- The mainstream misunderstands government finance—deficits don't inherently cause inflation
- Interest rate policy is a blunt and ineffective tool compared to fiscal policy
- The fear of inflation is used to justify unnecessary austerity

**From Austrians:**
- Mainstream measures of inflation (CPI) miss the most important distortions
- Focus on consumer prices ignores asset price inflation and capital structure distortions
- Central bank manipulation of interest rates causes malinvestment and boom-bust cycles
- The "solution" (central bank intervention) is actually the cause of the problem

**From Ecological Economists:**
- The model ignores biophysical constraints—you cannot infinitely expand supply
- Resource depletion and environmental costs create inflationary pressures that monetary policy cannot address
- Growth assumptions underlying the model are physically impossible to sustain

**General Heterodox Critique:**
- The model is too abstract and mathematical, divorced from institutional reality
- It assumes away power relations, class conflict, and political economy
- Empirical track record is mixed at best—didn't predict 2008 or 2021-23 inflation surge
- The emphasis on expectations and credibility serves to discipline democratic fiscal policy
