# Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) View on Inflation

## 1. Overview

Modern Monetary Theory offers a distinctive analysis of inflation grounded in its understanding of how modern fiat currency systems actually work. For MMT, inflation is not fundamentally about money supply or even about aggregate demand in the abstract—it's about spending (public or private) pushing against the economy's real productive capacity. When spending exceeds what the economy can actually produce, the result is inflation.

This may sound similar to mainstream "demand-pull" inflation, but MMT's framing differs crucially. In the mainstream view, government spending is constrained by revenues and borrowing capacity, so "too much" spending is often framed in terms of deficits. For MMT, a currency-issuing government faces no financial constraint—it cannot run out of its own currency. The real constraint is inflation: spending beyond real productive capacity causes prices to rise. This reframes the entire debate about government budgets from "can we afford it?" to "do we have the real resources?"

MMT economists—particularly Warren Mosler, L. Randall Wray, Stephanie Kelton, Bill Mitchell, and Pavlina Tcherneva—argue that inflation is best controlled not through interest rate policy but through fiscal policy, taxation, and crucially, through the Job Guarantee: a public option for employment at a fixed wage that acts as a price anchor while achieving genuine full employment.

## 2. Core Claims

- A currency-issuing government (with its own sovereign currency, floating exchange rate, and no foreign-currency debt) cannot run out of money
- Government spending is not revenue-constrained; the constraint is real resources and inflation
- Inflation occurs when spending (public or private) exceeds the economy's real productive capacity
- The money supply is endogenous—it's created by government spending and bank lending, not controlled by the central bank
- Taxes do not fund government spending; they serve to create demand for the currency and drain spending power from the economy
- The true purpose of taxation is to control inflation, alter distribution, and discourage undesirable activities—not to raise revenue
- The NAIRU is a policy choice, not a natural constraint—it represents the unemployment rate the government chooses to accept
- Interest rate policy is a weak and problematic tool for controlling inflation
- The Job Guarantee is the optimal way to achieve full employment with price stability
- Deficits are not inherently inflationary; they add to private sector financial assets

## 3. Causal Mechanism

**The spending-capacity framework:**

1. The government (and private sector) spend money into the economy
2. This spending creates demand for goods and services
3. The economy responds by producing goods and services—as long as there are idle resources
4. When spending exceeds productive capacity (labor, equipment, materials are fully employed), additional spending just bids up prices
5. This is inflation: too much spending chasing too few real goods and services

**Why government deficits are not inherently inflationary:**

- A deficit means government spending exceeds taxation
- The net effect is that the private sector has more financial assets (the deficit adds to private savings)
- If the economy has unused capacity (unemployment, idle factories), deficit spending puts those resources to work without causing inflation
- Inflation only occurs when spending reaches the capacity constraint

**The tax-drain mechanism:**

- Taxes remove spending power from the economy
- If inflation is too high, increasing taxes (or reducing spending) can cool demand
- This is fiscal policy, not monetary policy, as the primary inflation control tool

**The Job Guarantee as price anchor:**

1. Government offers a job to anyone willing to work at a fixed wage (e.g., $15/hour plus benefits)
2. This sets a floor on wages and employment—no one need be involuntarily unemployed
3. In a downturn, people flow into the Job Guarantee pool (counter-cyclical stabilizer)
4. In an upturn, private employers hire from the Job Guarantee pool at slightly higher wages
5. The fixed Job Guarantee wage acts as an anchor for wages throughout the economy
6. This achieves full employment without triggering a wage-price spiral

**Why interest rate policy is problematic:**

- Higher interest rates are income for bondholders—potentially inflationary, not deflationary
- Rate increases hurt debtors (working class) and help creditors (wealthy)—regressive redistribution
- The transmission mechanism (higher rates → less borrowing → less spending → less inflation) is unreliable
- It works (when it does) by causing unemployment—a cruel and inefficient tool
- MMT recommends setting rates at zero (or low) and using fiscal policy for stabilization

## 4. Key Assumptions

- **Monetary sovereignty matters:** The analysis applies to countries that issue their own currency, have a floating exchange rate, and don't borrow in foreign currencies. It does not apply to eurozone countries, currency boards, or countries with dollar-denominated debt

- **Currency is a public monopoly:** The government is the sole issuer of its currency. This monopoly gives it pricing power if it chooses to use it (via the Job Guarantee wage)

- **Taxes create demand for currency:** People need the government's currency to pay taxes. This is what gives fiat money value

- **Unemployment is a policy choice:** The government can always create jobs by spending. Persistent unemployment reflects insufficient spending, not natural equilibrium

- **Inflation is a real phenomenon:** Inflation reflects real bottlenecks, supply constraints, and distributional conflicts—not just "too much money"

- **Sectoral balances must sum to zero:** Government deficit = private surplus + foreign surplus. These are accounting identities, not theories

- **Full employment is achievable without accelerating inflation:** The Job Guarantee provides a mechanism to employ everyone at a stable wage

## 5. Policy Prescriptions

**Use fiscal policy as the primary stabilization tool:**
- Adjust government spending and taxation to manage aggregate demand
- Automatic stabilizers (Job Guarantee, progressive taxes) provide ongoing adjustment
- Discretionary fiscal policy for larger shocks

**Implement a Job Guarantee:**
- Offer employment to all who want it at a fixed, living wage
- Provides a buffer stock of employed workers (vs. the current buffer stock of unemployed)
- Wage anchor prevents inflationary spirals while achieving full employment
- Work should be useful—community service, care work, environmental restoration

**Set interest rates low and stable:**
- The "natural" rate is zero—government should not pay interest on its own liabilities
- Interest rate policy is an ineffective and regressive tool
- Low rates reduce the income of rentiers, reduce debt burdens, encourage investment

**Don't target the deficit; target outcomes:**
- The "right" deficit is whatever achieves full employment with price stability
- There's no reason to balance the budget or hit arbitrary deficit targets
- The deficit will naturally vary counter-cyclically with automatic stabilizers

**Address sectoral inflation directly:**
- If housing costs are driving inflation, build more housing
- If healthcare costs are rising, reform healthcare
- If energy prices spike, invest in energy infrastructure
- General demand management is a blunt tool when inflation is sector-specific

**Use taxation strategically:**
- Tax to reduce inequality (concentrated wealth can bid up prices)
- Tax to discourage undesirable activities (carbon, speculation)
- Tax to remove excess spending power if inflation threatens
- Don't tax to "pay for" spending—the government doesn't need your money to spend

## 6. Supporting Evidence

**The COVID-19 fiscal response:**
- Massive deficits did not cause immediate inflation (much went to saving, debt repayment)
- When inflation came in 2021-22, it was supply-driven (bottlenecks, shipping, energy)
- Demonstrated that deficit spending doesn't mechanically cause inflation

**Japan's experience:**
- Decades of large deficits and enormous government debt
- Yet persistent deflation or very low inflation
- Direct contradiction of the "deficits cause inflation" narrative

**World War II fiscal expansion:**
- Massive deficit spending during the war
- Inflation was controlled through rationing, price controls, and taxation
- Post-war prosperity, not hyperinflation

**The 2021-2023 inflation:**
- Initial cause was clearly supply disruption (COVID, supply chains, shipping)
- Energy price shock (Russian invasion of Ukraine)
- Profit margins expanded substantially—profit-push inflation
- Not driven by "excessive" government deficits or loose money

**Unemployment as policy choice:**
- Countries that choose to spend more have lower unemployment
- The US achieved very low unemployment in 2022-23 without runaway inflation
- Historical full employment periods (1940s, 1960s, early 2000s) were not inflationary disasters

**Endogenous money evidence:**
- Same evidence as post-Keynesians cite: loans create deposits
- Central bank research confirms money creation is demand-driven
- Attempts at monetary aggregate targeting failed

**Hyperinflation cases:**
- MMT analysis: hyperinflations result from collapse of productive capacity, not just "printing money"
- Weimar: loss of industrial capacity, reparations obligations in foreign currency
- Zimbabwe: destruction of agricultural capacity, political collapse
- Venezuela: collapse of oil production, political dysfunction
- Common factor: supply collapse, often combined with foreign currency debt

## 7. Acknowledged Weaknesses

**Political economy challenges:**
- Even if MMT is correct, politicians may misuse the framework to justify wasteful spending
- "We can afford anything" may be heard as "deficits don't matter"
- Inflation hawks will always have political ammunition

**The Job Guarantee is untested at scale:**
- No modern economy has implemented a full Job Guarantee
- Design and implementation details are complex
- Potential for political manipulation of the program

**Exchange rate vulnerability:**
- For countries that import essential goods, excessive spending can depreciate the currency
- Currency depreciation causes imported inflation
- MMT applies most cleanly to the US, less clearly to smaller open economies

**Inflation can be hard to control once started:**
- Even with correct diagnosis (supply-side), political tools are slow
- Building housing, energy infrastructure, supply chains takes time
- Meanwhile, expectations and distributional conflict can embed inflation

**The "real resource" constraint is hard to measure:**
- When is the economy at capacity? How do you know?
- Capacity is sector-specific and changes over time
- There's no simple aggregate measure like the NAIRU (which MMT rejects anyway)

**Not a complete theory of inflation:**
- MMT focuses on demand exceeding supply but has less to say about cost-push, imported inflation, and distributional conflict
- Shares this with mainstream—inflation is complex

**Relies on functional political institutions:**
- Fiscal policy requires democratic decision-making
- Dysfunctional politics can lead to poor decisions regardless of economic framework

## 9. Common Critiques (from other schools)

**From Mainstream/Neoclassical:**
- "MMT says deficits don't matter" (MMT response: deficits matter for inflation, not for "affordability")
- The framework ignores incentive effects and distortions from taxation
- Interest rate policy does work—the evidence supports it
- The Job Guarantee would be inflationary or create make-work
- MMT overestimates government's ability to manage the economy

**From Monetarists:**
- At its core, MMT is just saying "print money to pay for things"—this is inflationary
- Historical evidence shows money printing leads to inflation
- The dismissal of interest rate policy is unfounded

**From Austrians:**
- MMT misunderstands the nature of money and value
- Fiat currency is inherently unstable; MMT embraces the source of instability
- The theory enables unlimited government expansion
- Government spending distorts the economy regardless of inflation

**From Post-Keynesians:**
- MMT overstates the case for fiscal policy; sometimes monetary policy is appropriate
- The tax-driven money story is overstated
- MMT is too US-centric—doesn't apply well to other countries
- Some post-Keynesians see MMT as a subset of post-Keynesian economics; others see real differences

**From Ecological Economists:**
- MMT still assumes growth is possible and desirable
- The "just spend more to grow more" logic ignores biophysical limits
- Full employment in a growth context is ecologically problematic

**General critiques:**
- The theory is unfalsifiable—any inflation is attributed to "real" supply constraints
- It's politically naive about how governments actually behave
- The Job Guarantee is bureaucratically complex and politically unrealistic
- Downplays the difficulty of controlling inflation once it starts
