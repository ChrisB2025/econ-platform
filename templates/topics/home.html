            <p>
                Economics is contested terrain. Different schools of thought offer different explanations
                for how economies work, what causes problems like inflation and unemployment, and what
                policies might help.
            </p>
            <p>
                This platform presents each perspective in its strongest form, subjects all views to
                the same critical scrutiny, and lets you draw your own conclusions.
            </p>

                <h3>Our Principles</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Teaching, not advocacy</strong> - Help you understand, not convert you</li>
                    <li><strong>Honest about limitations</strong> - Acknowledge contested evidence</li>
